<span>THE BRIDGE OF DREAMS</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">One</span> sultry September afternoon, some years ago,
my brother Ronald and I, being tired and dusty,
found a temporary resting-place on the parapet of
a little old bridge that spanned a sleepy stream.
Through a thin silk blouse a comforting sun beat
upon my back, and I was serenely conscious of an
unusual sense of happiness and well-being&mdash;though
I owed little to my surroundings. In all England
it would have been difficult to find a more featureless
and monotonous outlook than the prospect that lay
stretched before us. A series of flat, marshy fields,
exhibiting here a space of willowy green, and there
a patch of black soil, enclosed by ragged hedges
or deep, dark dykes. Occasionally a few lonely
and distorted trees, or a humped-up cluster of red
roofs, varied the scene, which gradually faded until
sky and horizon seemed to melt away into one pale
blur.</p>

<p>“What a region!” exclaimed Ronnie, as he
tossed away the stump of a cigarette. “The back
of beyond, the Land of Never Never! Never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
again, so far as I am concerned! Who discovered
it?”</p>

<p>“It was discovered by the Danes, I believe,”
I answered; “they say it was once under the sea.”</p>

<p>“A pity it did not stay there!”</p>

<p>“It’s rather cheerful now, and the air is splendid;
but you should see it in winter, when it has a grey,
weird, starving sort of look, and the face of the
country is like a dead thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, thank goodness, I am spared that,” rejoined
Ronnie. “I shall be out in the nice sultry
East, sunning myself among the big red boulders
that are scattered round Secunderabad.”</p>

<p>“And you start on Friday? Oh, Ronnie, I
believe you are <i>glad</i> to go back!”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am jolly glad, only for leaving you, old
girl&mdash;and in such a hole as Beke. My leave has gone
like a flash; just a month at home. I must say it
is a beastly shame they did not ask you to Torrington
when I was there.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Mina sees as little of me as possible&mdash;she
does not like me, and is at no pains to conceal
the fact. The girls and I have never what you
call ‘got on’; we have nothing in common. You
see I am much younger than they are.”</p>

<p>“And so much better looking,” supplemented
my brother.</p>

<p>Waving aside his compliment, I continued:</p>

<p>“You know, when I first went to Torrington
I was a small child, and by all accounts dreadfully
spoiled; later on, in the holidays, I was too young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
to appear in company, and was generally hustled out
of sight. My goodness, but it was dull, all alone,
in the old nursery! Coming down to lunch as a
treat, cross-examined and snubbed by the girls, and
overawed by Aunt Mina&mdash;she had a way of looking
at me that made me feel as if I had no clothes
on!”</p>

<p>“My dear Eva, don’t be improper!”</p>

<p>“You see,” I resumed&mdash;now comfortably embarked
on a flowing tide of talk, and eager to impart
my confidence to a sympathetic ear&mdash;“I can
realise what a nuisance I was in those days. The
house was full of grown-ups and smart people, and
I was just a lanky girl who slunk in to lunch or
was met roaming about the grounds! Then twice
I brought home infection, and gave most of the
establishment mumps and chicken-pox&mdash;so you
can’t wonder that I was not popular! After all, I
am only Aunt Mina’s niece by marriage; Uncle is
nice to me in his cheery, vague, irresponsible way,
but he has no <i>say</i>. Living in the nursery, I naturally
heard a good deal of backstairs talk, and
gathered that Aunt manages everything&mdash;even to
evicting tenants and arranging the shoots.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come! I don’t think it is as bad as all
that,” protested Ronnie; “though of course a man
who marries half a million must pay <i>some</i> sort of
interest. The family were in very deep water,
when potted meat came along and hauled them
out. When were you last at Torrington?”</p>

<p>“Two years ago this Christmas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<p>Ronnie was about to exclaim, but I put my
hand over his mouth.</p>

<p>“Do let <i>me</i> talk,” I pleaded. “I want to tell you
things I can’t write. It was the Christmas before
last. I was in long frocks with my hair up, and had
just left Cheltenham. I caught a slight cold on the
journey, but was nevertheless in the wildest spirits,
full of anticipation of the delights that awaited
me now that I was officially fledged.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” interrupted Ronnie impatiently;
“that is all stale news.”</p>

<p>“The evening after I arrived there was a dinner
party, and I happened by good luck to sit next to
a charming man, who was very agreeable, and no
doubt drew me out. A lively girl sat opposite
to us; she had a loud voice, and talked the most
ridiculous nonsense, much appreciated by Beverley,
her neighbour.</p>

<p>“‘What is your family disease?’ she asked
him; ‘ours is softening of the bones.’ And Bev
replied:</p>

<p>“‘Our hereditary disease is gambling.’</p>

<p>“‘Which leads,’ said the girl, ‘to softening of the
<i>brain</i>!’”</p>

<p>I paused, turned to my brother, and said:</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear that there was gambling
in the Lingard family?”</p>

<p>“There’s a taste for gambling in every family,”
he answered evasively. “Well, go on about your
dinner party. What happened?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I allowed my spirits to get the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
better of me, for I laughed and chattered incessantly.
I know I always talk too much.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of that&mdash;when you get the chance,”
corroborated my listener.</p>

<p>“I pulled crackers, put on paper caps, exchanged
mottoes and poetry, and in short enjoyed
myself enormously. Afterwards, when the men
came into the drawing-room, my dinner friend found
me out at once, and at his suggestion we retired
into an obscure corner, in order to cement our acquaintance.
All at once I began to notice that
the surrounding atmosphere was chilly: I saw my
cousins whispering together, and I believe Clara
summoned her mother, for presently Aunt Mina
swooped upon us, and told my companion that she
had something she particularly wished to show him,
and, in spite of his obvious reluctance, she took him
in charge, and marched him off. A significant glance
assured me that I was in deep disgrace, and when
people had settled down to music or bridge I stole
away to bed.”</p>

<p>“Best place for you,” interposed Ronnie.</p>

<p>“I was woke out of my first sleep by Clara,
who came into my room, candle in hand, wearing
her most venomous expression; the visit was on
purpose to inform me that she ‘was really <i>sorry</i>
I had made such a dreadful exhibition of myself at
dinner, laughing and screaming at the top of my
voice, pulling crackers, sticking things in my hair,
altogether behaving like a shop girl’! I heard no
more beyond a murmur, as I covered up my head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
with the bed clothes. When at last I was compelled
to emerge from want of air, the room was in darkness,
and my cousin had disappeared. As my cold was
pretty bad I was confined to my old quarters, the
nursery, and there I remained for several days.
Beverley, just home from Eton, used to come and
sit with me, and bring me the news. He informed
me that Major Halliday, my charming friend, had
been making tender inquiries after me, adding: ‘I
suppose you didn’t happen to know that he is by
way of being Clara’s young man&mdash;she had all but
landed him!’</p>

<p>“Bev befriended me&mdash;supplied me with magazines
and chocolates, but when he began to make love to
me&mdash;that was another pair of shoes!”</p>

<p>“So I should think&mdash;the moon-faced idiot!”
commented Ronnie.</p>

<p>“Well, one afternoon he tried to kiss me, and
was actually chasing me round the table, when Aunt
Mina entered. She was furious. Bev fled headlong,
and on me she poured all the vials of her wrath.
She said I was a bold, designing minx, a disgrace to
the family. For once I protested, and protested
with fury&mdash;assured her that I loathed the sight
of Bev, and never wished to see him again&mdash;no,
nor anyone at Torrington! Naturally I was soon
squashed. Aunt was too strong for me, and the
scene ended in humiliation and tears. Possibly my
prolonged weeping increased my cold, which presently
developed alarmingly. The local doctor (Aunt Mina’s
slave) was summoned. He talked gravely about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
pneumonia, and my lungs, and announced that I had
a delicate chest, and must on <i>no</i> account remain
at Torrington&mdash;the place was too low and enervating&mdash;so
I was promptly packed off to Beke, where
I have been ever since!”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Ronnie. “Why, it
is a sort of countrified Bastille. How on earth
did Aunt Mina discover it?”</p>

<p>“Quite easily,” I replied. “Miss Puckle was the
girls’ governess when I was small. I remember her
well; so trim and punctual, and authoritative,
with a trick of pulling down her belt if she was
going to be disagreeable, but always indulgent to me.
When I was in trouble I used to sit on her lap and
just sob and sob.”</p>

<p>“I wonder you don’t do it now,” said Ronnie.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I am a size too large. As for
Beke, some years ago an old relation died and left
a fine legacy and ‘The Roost’ between Lizzie and her
uncle the professor, so they retired together, and are
now in what is called ‘easy circumstances.’ I
contribute a hundred a year.”</p>

<p>“You are humbugging! Why, they ought to pay
<i>you</i> as companion&mdash;and lady help.”</p>

<p>“Aunt arranged everything; she declared I
could not be better off than at ‘The Roost.’ The
doctor particularly recommended this marshy air,
with a dash of sea, she said, and I might continue
my music and sketching with Lizzie&mdash;who would
finish me properly.”</p>

<p>“<i>Finish</i> you indeed!” cried Ronnie, “I wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Beke has not finished you long ago. Hallo, I say,
who are the riders coming down the road? Shall
I put my arm round your neck and pretend I am
your sweetheart, and give the poor natives a fresh
piece of gossip?”</p>

<p>“Put your arm round my neck if you like, but
all the village knows that you are my brother, my
only near relation. Clarice has a cousin at ‘The
Beetle,’ which is our newsagency.”</p>

<p>“Clarice,” repeated Ronnie, “is that the shuffling
parlour-maid with the cock eye?”</p>

<p>“She is a capital servant,” I replied, “and sees
as much as three. Here come the Soadys.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?&mdash;tell me quickly,” urged Ronnie.</p>

<p>“Sam Soady and his daughter. She is the only
girl I know in these parts, and has been my great
stand-by. He is a rich farmer, sells cattle and horses,
and lives in an old manor house the other side of
Beke.”</p>

<p>Almost before I concluded, the Soadys were
upon us, a fine, solid, up-sitting pair, with the same
open countenances, ruddy cheeks and blue eyes.
As they halted, Tossie cried out:</p>

<p>“Hallo, Eva, fancy seeing you roosting beside the
road!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my brother says I have walked him off
his legs. Let me introduce him to you. Mr.
Lingard, Miss Soady, and Mr. Soady.”</p>

<p>The latter touched his cap and said in his loud,
hoarse voice:</p>

<p>“Not much to see in these parts, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<p>“No, I have not come across anything to touch
your two gees; fine weight-carriers,” walking over
to his side as he spoke&mdash;horses always attracted
Ronnie.</p>

<p>“Aye, they are good ‘uns,” assented the farmer,
“and rarely bred. My girl and I have been giving
them a bit of a gallop in the fields yonder now the
crops are in, getting them fit for the cub-hunting.
I will be pleased to do a deal, sir,” he added
jocosely.</p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully, but I ride ten stone, and I’m
off to India on Friday. I should have thought you
would only have had otter hunting in this part of the
country.”</p>

<p>“Round here there is naught but water rats,
but on our side of Beke there is rare fine going, and
two good packs within reach.”</p>

<p>During this conversation Tossie was considering
Ronnie with an air of fascinated attention; her eyes
resembled two blue glass balls, and her gaze expressed
undisguised approval. Ronnie and I were the same
height&mdash;that is to say, five-foot-eight. He was
slight, well set up, and remarkably good looking.
From his earliest childhood he had been excessively
particular about his personal appearance, had never
objected to having his hair brushed and his hands
washed, and, as he stood on the road before Miss
Soady, he presented a picture of a thoroughly well
turned out and admirably groomed young man.
Tweed suit, boots and shirt, were precisely what they
should be; his glossy hair was delicately scented;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
socks, tie and handkerchief were all in sympathy;
and yet there was nothing remarkable in his get-up&mdash;it
was subdued, simple, and absolutely “the right
thing.” What a contrast to my own countrified
appearance in a home-made serge skirt, a baggy
blouse, sunburnt sailor hat, and bare hands&mdash;we
rarely wore gloves at Beke.</p>

<p>Ronnie now turned to Tossie’s horse, patted its
damp neck, and looking up at the rider, said:</p>

<p>“So I hear you and my sister are great pals; she
tells me you have been awfully kind to her.”</p>

<p>“Not a little bit of it, it’s the other way on,”
she protested in her loud, far-reaching contralto.</p>

<p>“Eva keeps us all alive, she plays tennis like a
professional, and her singing is just a treat. Are
you making a stay?”</p>

<p>“No, I am off to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“A little of the professor goes a long way?” she
suggested archly.</p>

<p>“I did not come to see him, but my sister,” he
answered stiffly.</p>

<p>“Aye, I expect you came home to look up missie,”
put in Sam. “There be only the two of you.”</p>

<p>“Partly, and partly business; it is bad luck I
can’t wait on and have a shot at the partridge.”</p>

<p>“Aye, and I could give you a rare day’s sport.
Well, maybe another time,” said the farmer. “Now
Tossie, these horses be too warm to be kept standing.
Good-day, sir, and good luck. Good-day, missie&mdash;see
you soon,” and he moved off.</p>

<p>Tossie, I observed, was not disposed to follow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
but inclined to linger and improve her acquaintance
with Ronnie.</p>

<p>“I think your sister <i>might</i> have brought you
up to see us, Mr. Lingard; I do, indeed,” she said
emphatically.</p>

<p>“We have only had a short time together, Miss
Soady, and Eva had such a lot of talking to get
through,” he replied with his charming smile; “better
luck next time.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” agreed Tossie, as she wrung his
hand, and, with obvious reluctance, followed her
parent. As they departed at a walking pace Ronnie
declaimed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘I saw them go: one horse was blind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tails of both hung down behind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Their shoes were on their feet.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“All the same, those are fine weight carriers, and
have lots of bone. That girl must ride thirteen stone,
if she weighs an ounce. I think she seemed a little
sniffy because you did not take me there to pay a
visit of ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ronnie, I have only had you for two days,
and the day we spent together in London.”</p>

<p>“Well then, let’s make the most of our time,” he
said, seating himself once more on the bridge, “and
continue to talk of our joys and sorrows.”</p>

<p>“<i>Your</i> joys and <i>my</i> sorrows,” I corrected.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is something in that. I have, ten to
one, the best of it. Here am I at six-and-twenty,
on the point of getting my company, returning to a
life that suits me down to the ground, strong and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
healthy, with lots of pals, and a fat balance at Cox’s.
Oh, Sis, I tell you, it’s jolly to be alive!” and he
thumped me violently on the back. “This old world
is a grand place; I have a feeling in my bones that in
some way my name will ring through it&mdash;my subconscious
what-you-may-call-it tells me that I am
going to have a ripping career&mdash;I shall make the race
of Lingard famous!”</p>

<p>“I hope you will, with all my heart,” I answered
with enthusiasm. “And I shall play the part of
proud sister to the manner born.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have always been my backer,” said
Ronnie, “and no end of a brick.”</p>

<p>“What happens to you in a way affects me; your
good luck will be my good luck. Perhaps this old
bridge may be uncanny, for I too have my premonitions,
and I believe that in some unexpected way our
fortunes will be bound together.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there’s not much chance of that,”
said Ronnie, “but who knows?” Then, starting
to his feet, “Oh, Lord, here are the professor and
Lizzie coming to look for us! We can finish our
jaw in the garden, after our so-called dinner. Let
us advance to meet them, it saves time, and looks
<i>empressé</i>. Call up that dog, he is hunting water
rats. Well, good-bye, old bridge,” he went on, slapping
the grey stone parapet as he spoke, “I don’t
expect we shall ever meet again, but I jolly well hope
those visions will come true!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_2">CHAPTER II<br />
<span>BEKE</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Professor Septimus Puckle</span> must have been
considerably over sixty years of age, a burly, slouching
figure, moving with a ponderous and pompous
gait; he had a grey beard, two shallow little brown
eyes, and a dome-shaped head covered by a soft cap&mdash;he
also wore a roomy suit of creased black-and-white
flannel, and elastic-side boots. In these days,
Lizzie, his niece, seemed elderly to me&mdash;possibly she
may have been about forty. Her figure was remarkably
pretty, and her sharp, clever face was illuminated
by a pair of bright eyes which shone steadily behind
a pince-nez. Perhaps her manner was somewhat abrupt
and authoritative, but Lizzie was a capable and cultivated
woman, with a level head and warm heart.</p>

<p>“So here you are!” began the professor; “we have
come out to look for you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully,” replied my brother, “but
there’s not much fear of being lost in these parts, as
apparently there is only one road.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we have others&mdash;several others,” protested
Lizzie. “Where is Kipper?” now looking about.
“We must be getting back to tea, as I have a choir
practice at half-past five,” and she screamed “Kipper!
Kipper! Kipper!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<p>After a momentary delay, Kipper emerged from
under the bridge a deplorable object, dripping with
muddy water, and immediately proceeded to shake
himself in our vicinity.</p>

<p>“Get away! get away!” shouted the professor,
making a drive at him with his stick.</p>

<p>“Oh, poor boy!” I interposed, “he has been
hunting rats, and having such a happy time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all he thinks of, the horrid brute.
I hate the sight of him,” declared his master.</p>

<p>“Uncle Sep loved him till you came, Eva, and
cut him out in Kipper’s affections.”</p>

<p>We had now turned homewards, that is to say, in
the direction from where the dagger-like spire of
Beke church rose from the plain, and were walking
four abreast, adapting our pace to the professor’s
self-conscious waddle, with the humbled Kipper
skulking in our wake.</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Uncle Sep in his deep, scholastic
voice, “I don’t mind telling you, when the fellow was
a pup I tolerated him, took him round the garden,
suffered him to lie at my fire, and even gave him milk;
and for thanks, he tore up my new slippers and several
most important papers. I even forgave him that!”
emphasising such generosity with a large, fat hand.
“But when Eva arrived he simply turned me down,
ignored my existence, never answered when I called
him, no, no more than if I was a piece of furniture;
to be dropped by a dog makes one rather small!”</p>

<p>“I am sure you could never feel that!” protested
Ronnie with dangerous frivolity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p>“Well, but, Uncle Sep,” hastily interposed Lizzie,
“you know Eva takes Kip for long runs over the
marshes, she brushes him, makes up his dinner&mdash;<i>your</i>
friendship was merely passive.”</p>

<p>“He was glad enough of it once,” rejoined the
injured patron; “but two can play at that game.
Now I never open a door for him&mdash;on principle.”</p>

<p>“So you have your innings!” exclaimed my
irrepressible brother, “and I am sure you have
something else to do than wait on a cold-hearted
terrier. By the way, how do you put in your time?
Do you play golf?”</p>

<p>“Golf? No&mdash;do I look like golf?” The professor
halted, and leaning both hands on his stick,
challenged an opinion.</p>

<p>“Well, no,” admitted Ronnie. “You look more
like fishing&mdash;lots of sitting&mdash;eh?”</p>

<p>“I sit at my desk, my good sir, I fish for ideas. I
write poetry, articles, reviews. ‘My mind to me a
kingdom is’&mdash;<i>I</i> require no outside interests.”</p>

<p>“No; but what about outside exercise?”</p>

<p>“Exercise!” repeated the professor; “the world
is crazy on that subject. I was brought up to a
sedentary life; even at school I never went in for
games, but was always keen on brain work. For years
I was Lecturer and Professor of Classics and English
Literature. Now I have retired my time is my own.
I am enjoying the luxury of leisure, and I don’t mind
telling you that in my lighter mood I write plays.”</p>

<p>“Plays!” echoed Ronnie, staring at the professor
with blank incredulity. “By George, do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I have one now, a four-act comedy, under
consideration at the Metropolitan Theatre. Just at
present I am hard at work on the history of Slacklands
and our local folk-lore.”</p>

<p>The mere mention of the subject loosened the
professor’s tongue, and all the way home&mdash;and
almost without drawing breath&mdash;he held forth on
this topic in a full, monotonous voice, and with a
fierce determination that would brook no interruption.
Ronnie, poor victim, was helpless, so to
speak, benumbed, by such an unusual experience;
and I could not help smiling to myself as I glanced
at his face of furious boredom. Our arrival at the
village of Beke put an end to the lecture. The
professor could not well continue declaiming and
ranting in public&mdash;as was his custom in his own
garden&mdash;and the sight of the first cottage was the
signal for our release. Beke, a dreary old village,
which had seen better days, consisted of one long,
clean street, lined with irregular red-roofed houses,
some of a great age. Half-way up the thoroughfare
stood the church, a notable edifice, with flying buttresses,
surrounded by the tombstones of its dead
parishioners. Facing the church was the “Beetle
Inn,” a crooked black-and-white hostelry, which kept
the only fly in the country; farther on, the Parsonage
and “The Roost” confronted one another; the
latter, a trim, red, Georgian residence, was approached
by a brick path across a small enclosure, at present
gay with a multitude of pink and lilac phlox.</p>

<p>Outwardly “The Roost” was insignificant, within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
both roomy and comfortable. The walls were wainscoted,
the fireplaces of generous space. The doors
of the principal rooms were of rich South American
mahogany, and most of the furniture was quaint and
old-fashioned: in former days “The Roost” had
been the abode of taste and leisure. Now, alas!
times were sadly changed.</p>

<p>The professor had ample leisure but no taste;
his niece had a cultivated taste but no leisure&mdash;all
her spare hours were dedicated to the parson and
the parish.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly these changes had been anticipated,
for a deeply cut carving on a panel in the passage
said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All terrene things by turns we see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Become another’s property.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mine now must be another’s soon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know not whose, when I am gone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An earthly house is bound to none.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A glass door at the back of the hall opened upon
an unexpectedly large garden, gently sloping to the
sluggish river; here there were long gravel walks&mdash;worn
bare by the professor’s pacing&mdash;bordered
with box and old standard roses. Here was also a
notable mulberry tree, several rustic seats, and a
sundial on which was inscribed, “Time will tell.”</p>

<p>That evening a full white moon illuminated the
land, and after dinner Ronnie and I effected our
escape, and strolled to and fro arm in arm along the
professor’s pet walk; this would be our last hour
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p>“I cannot stand that slovenly old bore,” said
Ronnie. “Did you notice the ink on his fingers
and the crumbs in his beard? I don’t know which
is the worst&mdash;his drivelling talk or his appearance.
I wonder he hasn’t driven you mad long ago. I’ve
only been here two days, and already my reason is
tottering. Does he <i>never</i> stop talking?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” I replied, “when he is not pleased
and sulks.”</p>

<p>“Is it really true that he writes plays?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for his own entertainment. They are
never accepted. He spends lots of money on dramatic
agents, typewriting, and so on, and, as a great favour,
he generally reads the plays to me.”</p>

<p>“You long-suffering martyr! I should certainly
kick at that.”</p>

<p>“They are not so bad; it is his poetry that I cannot
endure&mdash;so sickeningly sweet, it makes me feel
positively squeamish! Sometimes he brings it to
meals and reads it between the courses, and says,
‘Lizzie and Eva, you must really hear this, it is
<i>delicious</i>.’”</p>

<p>“What lunacy!” cried Ronnie. “It seems to
me you would be just as well off in an asylum for
idiots.”</p>

<p>“By no means,” I objected; “the professor is
as dull as a wet Sunday, but Lizzie is immensely
clever, a thorough musician, speaks French like a
native, and has no end of certificates. She was
governess in the family of a Russian Grand Duke
before she went to Torrington. Besides, I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
really fond of her; I think she finds Uncle Sep
trying at times, and after he has read me a play
she will say, ‘Now don’t pretend you liked it, Eva&mdash;speak
the truth. Tell him it is just wordy <i>rubbish</i>!
I implore you not to encourage him; as long as he
writes letters and poetry for the <i>Slacklands Post</i>
it is all right, but the plays burn a hole in his pocket.’
He is really not a bad old boy&mdash;rather simple
and weak, in spite of his fierce eyebrows&mdash;anyone,
even a child, can lead him by flattery.”</p>

<p>“I wish I saw my way to leading you out of
this hole,” said Ronnie; “my visit has been a
shocker; if they would only have you at Torrington&mdash;but
I suppose that as long as those girls are
unmarried you will be what I may call ‘reserved.’”</p>

<p>“I have no wish to go to Torrington,” I replied.
“Beke may be dull, but here I don’t live in fear and
trembling of anyone. I wonder why Aunt Mina, who
detests me, is so friendly to you?”</p>

<p>“I think I can answer that,” rejoined Ronnie.
“I am a Lingard&mdash;quite the family type&mdash;ears and
all. I am self-supporting, I have four hundred a
year, I have done pretty well for myself so far, and I
am in a crack regiment. Also I can shoot and dance,
make myself useful in a house party, and do not&mdash;like
my pretty sister&mdash;extinguish the girls or fascinate
Bev&mdash;quite the contrary, so far as he is concerned;
moreover, should anything happen to that long-necked
young pup, I am the next heir. When I told Aunt
Mina I was coming here she was inclined to be
apologetic, and said she was so sorry that Torrington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
did not agree with you, and that she had settled
you at Beke solely on account of your health and
education, as they had found you extraordinarily
young and unformed for your age. Tell me, Sis, how
do you put in your time when you are not doing
lessons?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dust the china, practise, go for long
walks with Kipper, poke round the village among
my friends, and play tennis with the Soadys, who
sometimes give me a mount. On wet days I help
Clarice to clean the silver, and besides all this I
read a lot. I’ve unearthed no end of old books in
a closet, some horribly musty, and printed with those
long S’s. I’ve just been devouring a fearsome tale,
called ‘Sir Lancelot Graves’&mdash;it’s all about a ghost
in armour.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother ghosts and books!” interrupted
Ronnie impatiently. “Have you no people of your
own class around here?”</p>

<p>“There are one or two big places,” I answered,
“but the Darlingfords and the De Veres would not
dream of visiting at ‘The Roost.’ Lizzie was only a
finishing governess, and Uncle Sep was never a real
professor; he is called that hereabouts, and he likes
it, and has come to believe in it himself.”</p>

<p>“And have you no variety at all?” Ronnie’s
tone was despairing.</p>

<p>“Yes, twice a year we spend a riotous fortnight
in London. We stay at a Bayswater boarding-house
that calls itself a private hotel, which the Puckles
always patronise. Lizzie and I stare into windows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
and compare opinions, do a little shopping and go
to concerts. Sep spends most of his time in theatres
and worries managers with his plays.”</p>

<p>For some moments after this announcement
Ronnie sat beside me in dead silence, then suddenly
he sprang to his feet and began to walk to and
fro along the professor’s well-beaten track; at last
he came to a halt and said:</p>

<p>“Eva, I had no idea of all this! You always
write such cheery letters&mdash;even that time in London
you were mum. It is thundering bad luck that I’m
obliged to be off so soon. However <i>something</i> has
got to be done. Uncle Horace must find you a more
suitable home. Look here, I have just hit on an
idea! I shall suggest your going out to India as a
P.G.&mdash;paying guest, you know&mdash;lots of girls do
that, and Anglo-Indians are glad enough of the coin
now that everything is so expensive. Of course the
people you go to must be top hole&mdash;that is understood.
Aunt Mina is a wonderful woman for references
and position, and I believe you will get along
famously; you can dance and sing and ride, and chatter
nineteen to the dozen. You and I will be on the
same continent, which will be a change. I shall
offer to pay your passage, and I expect Aunt Mina
will be so glad to be rid of you that she will give you
a ripping outfit&mdash;what do you think of my idea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ronnie,” I exclaimed, “it is too splendid
for words. How did it enter your head?”</p>

<p>“It came into my head just now as I walked up
and down and saw you crouched here on the garden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
seat, and thought of you cooped up in that gloomy
old house, with the sham professor, the clerical
governess, and the great empty, ugly country that cuts
you off from all the world&mdash;and you only nineteen!
Before I go to sleep this very night I shall write
Uncle Horace a letter that will make things move.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if your letter will move Aunt Mina or
remove me! Ronnie, wouldn’t it be lovely if I could
go out and keep house for you&mdash;I am such a clever
manager?”</p>

<p>“My dear, crazy child, if the colonel were to hear
you he would have fits. He bars married officers
and&mdash;&mdash;-”</p>

<p>“Is married himself,” I interrupted impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is, <i>she</i> married him. Away from
the regiment, he fell a prey, like Samson minus his
hair. She was an old maid, a squiress, with a long
pedigree and a large fortune. She was sick of her
village and schools, and of unflinching determination
to see the world; she met ‘James’ at a
dinner party, and, so to speak, nailed him! She’s
a rattling good sort I must confess, entertains a
lot, mothers what she calls ‘her boys,’ and keeps us
as well as she can under her own eye.”</p>

<p>“And he?”</p>

<p>“Is wrapped up in the regiment, its past glories,
its present fitness, and its future exploits. ‘James,’
as we call him, is as hard as flint, and as tough as boot
leather; the orderly room and parade ground are his
real home; he looks black on married couples and, if
possible, hurls them to the depot. If a subaltern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
were to adventure on matrimony, all I can say is, that
I would be sorry for him&mdash;and if I were to turn up
with a pretty sister I expect it would be a case of a
court-martial!”</p>

<p>“What a narrow-minded, detestable tyrant!”
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, but very civil in civil life; he plays a good
game of billiards, and is prominent in square dances
with ‘Burra mems.’ Apart from soldiering he is
delightfully tame, and will, so to speak, eat out of your
hand.”</p>

<p>“What is a Burra mem?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“You will know soon enough when you get east
of Suez.”</p>

<p>“Ah, if I ever do, perhaps you will see that my
presentiment will come true, and that we shall be
together always.”</p>

<p>“No such luck,” rejoined Ronnie. “Even if I do
succeed in transplanting you I am afraid it will be
a case of ‘so near and yet so far,’ though, of course,
wherever you may be I shall fly to see you. Now
I am off to write a scorcher to Uncle Horace.”</p>

<p>“It is awfully good of you, Ronnie, but I am afraid
you will find you have only wasted your time and a
penny stamp,” I replied as I followed him into “The
Roost.” Nevertheless, in spite of my dismal forebodings,
that night I lay awake for hours thinking over
Ronnie’s plan, and when at last I fell asleep I dreamt
of India.</p>

<span>A MEETING ON THE MARSHES</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Trains</span> from the station nearest to Beke ran at inconceivably
inconvenient hours; for instance, a
quarter to eight in the morning, and half-past four in
the afternoon, the latter wandering into London
about midnight. Ronnie, of course, departed by the
first, and I took leave of him in the front hall with
copious tears (the professor, in a plaid dressing-gown,
and with dishevelled locks, peering over the banisters).</p>

<p>“Buck up, old girl!” he said; “it will be all right;
within six months you will be hugging me in India.
Mind you write every mail, take great care of yourself&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;good-bye.”
Then he tore himself
away, and ran down the tiled footpath to where an
aged fly&mdash;once the equipage of a countess&mdash;and a
sprightly young horse were waiting to transport him
to the junction.</p>

<p>As I watched the light-hearted animal plunging
and straining at the shafts I was conscious of a
guilty hope that he and the venerable vehicle would
part company, and thus spare me Ronnie for a few
hours; but no, tottering and swaying, the ancient
landau rolled away intact.</p>

<p>Then I went upstairs to my own room, locked the
door, and huddled down in the deep window seat, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
to mourn and meditate. I seemed to have come to
the end of my hopes and had now nothing to look
forward to. A painful conviction for a young and
sanguine soul!</p>

<p>For one whole year Ronnie’s return had been
my lodestar; my first thought in the morning, my
last at night; now he had come and gone&mdash;it was all
so soon over. Surveying the future, what a bleak,
monotonous outlook lay before me. It appeared to
me that I might almost as well have been born
a cabbage or a thistle! So far as the result of Ronnie’s
letter was concerned, I had not been foolishly
sanguine; I knew Aunt Mina, from what might be
called her “wrong side,” and how she disliked anyone
to interfere with her settled plans; her plan with
respect to me was that I should remain harmlessly
at Beke, and I had frequently heard her express a
horror of India&mdash;a country that, in her opinion, was
full of second-rate people, fast, disreputable women
and impecunious gambling men; no, there would be
no gorgeous East for me, and I could not reasonably
expect to see Ronnie for three long years.</p>

<p>I must confess that for some days after my brother’s
departure I was a moping, undesirable house-mate;
even a letter from Marseilles, a gold wristlet watch,
and Tossie’s enthusiastic admiration for my beloved,
scarcely helped to raise the clouds. Still, it comforted
me to talk about him to Lizzie and Tossie, who were
both sincerely sympathetic&mdash;not so the professor,
who became portentously glum whenever Ronnie’s
name was mentioned, and sat silently aloof with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
air of Olympian detachment. Apparently their antipathy
had been mutual, for he imparted to the
parson, who told Tossie, who told me, that “young
Lingard was a conceited, empty-headed dandy, just
a good-for-nothing, impudent jackanapes!”</p>

<p>It was about this time, I imagine, that he began
to work with arduous enthusiasm upon a new play,
in which the ne’er-do-well and scapegrace was a full-sized
portrait of my brother&mdash;so far as his personal
appearance was concerned; particulars dealing with
his dress were given in microscopic detail. For
once there was much mystery concerning this effort.
Naturally the professor never read it to me, and for
this “let off” I was profoundly thankful, for it was
something of an ordeal to sit in a stuffy study, which
reeked of stale tobacco, dust, and worm-eaten furniture,
whilst Uncle Sep read aloud with sonorous
complacency, occasionally pausing to look over his
glasses and say, “That is a fine speech, eh? How
does it strike you?”</p>

<p>Lizzie, who was not a fellow sufferer, warmly
approved of these readings. “It was better,” she
declared, “not to disturb the amiable delusions of
our fellows, but to encourage such friends to believe
in themselves!” The result was that I was immured
in the study, administering to Uncle Sep’s vanity,
whilst she bustled about the village, doing parish
work or conferring with the rector.</p>

<p>The rector, a distinguished looking white-haired
old widower, had contrived to appropriate Lizzie
as lay worker and curate. Beke was a large and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
scattered parish, and she visited various outlying
hamlets on her bike, controlled the Sunday school,
undertook mothers’ meetings, the Red Cross, the
village nurse, Girls’ Friendly Society and the choir,
whilst the Reverend Clement Chesterfield enjoyed an
amount of spacious ease, and had ample leisure to
read the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>Spectator</i>, the heavier monthlies
and the particular class of literature which appealed
to him. When the rectory had guests or entertained
the bishop, Miss Puckle managed the housekeeping;
when the rector was sick, she made poultices and beef
tea, and nursed him most efficiently. All the village
believed it would be “a match,” although Mr.
Chesterfield was seventy. The rumour went further,
and one of his married nieces had lately invaded
Beke; her manner to Miss Puckle had been
pointedly disagreeable, and she was reported to
have “said things.”</p>

<p>Lizzie’s time, as may be supposed, was fully occupied,
but I had many empty hours in spite of practising
and readings. Some of these hours I filled in with
visits to my intimates in the villages, to the Soadys, or
by long tramps over the country, accompanied by
Kipper. To Myson’s Dyke was his favourite excursion;
here were rabbits, rabbits, and rabbits&mdash;oh,
such good hunting! Our path lay over a series of
ugly flat fields, ending in the palings and outlying
plantations of one of the big places.</p>

<p>On this particular occasion, although it happened
to be my birthday, my reflections were by no means
cheerful. The morning’s post had brought me the gift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
of a lace pocket-handkerchief from my cousin Dora
and a note in which she said, “Father had a letter
from Ronald; he said that you are looking splendid&mdash;so
much for Beke!”</p>

<p>So much for Beke indeed! Apparently Ronnie’s
appeal had fallen flat; there was not a word about
India. Alas! that door of escape was closed. As
I turned my face towards the village, and contemplated
the hateful, too familiar and forbidding path
across the dried-up marshes, a memory suddenly
flashed into my mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Over the meadows that blossom and wither</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rings but the note of a sea-bird’s song;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only the sun and the rain come hither.</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">All year long.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I asked myself impatiently how long was I to lead
this empty, dull existence? A life given over to
the monotonous duties of an alien household and
to pandering to the vanity of a garrulous old man!
My school-fellows wrote to me from time to time.
Several had asked me to visit them, but Aunt Mina
vetoed all such hospitalities. “These people,” she
said, “were not in our set. You must remember
that your grandmother was a duke’s daughter and
only associate with your own class, not with second-rate
acquaintances.” It was evident that she liked
to play dog-in-the-manger, and would neither suffer
me to stay with others nor offer me an invitation
herself!</p>

<p>As I strolled along in a melancholy mood, musing
on the misery of my virtual internment, an acute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
sense of homelessness overcame me. My eyes were
dim with tears of self-pity, when, through these
tears, I discerned a distant speck on the pathway;
it approached, gradually grew larger, and
presently materialised into the figure of a man,
tall, square-shouldered, and carrying a gun under
his arm. Nearer and nearer he strode, and when
within ten yards I saw that he was a well set-up,
soldierly individual, in orthodox shooting garb,
with dark, rather sleepy eyes and a masterful chin.
He looked me straight in the face, as we passed
almost touching&mdash;the sole human beings within
sight over miles of space. Kipper, with his hackles
on end, sniffed suspiciously at the man’s leggings, and
then, so to speak, “accepted him,” and I proceeded
homewards, listening to the steady tramp of a pair
of heavy shooting boots till the sound had ceased.
I had advanced a certain distance, when an imperative
curiosity impelled me to halt and look back&mdash;I
am well aware that this was a most unladylike
action; nevertheless I fell! To my horror and
embarrassment, I discovered that the stranger was
doing precisely the same thing, standing apparently
immovable as a milestone. Undoubtedly our curiosity
and, I think I may say, interest, had been mutual!
I was sincerely thankful that the distance was too
great for us to distinguish one another’s features,
and felt deeply ashamed, exquisitely flattered, and
painfully shy. Before I could turn he had
snatched off his cap and waved it to me! What
audacious impertinence! My heart beat unusually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
fast, and my face flamed. Here was an adventure
at last, and although its form was highly indiscreet&mdash;nevertheless
I liked it!</p>

<p>Possibly it may not be surprising when I state
that I thought of the stranger all the way home; my
mind was so full of him that the monotonous miles
seemed as yards. I recalled his upright bearing, his
handsome eyes, his kindly word to Kipper. Was
this the hero that every girl of nineteen sees in her
dreams? It is a remarkable fact that at dinner I,
who usually poured out my budget of small news&mdash;such
as, how someone had broken Mrs. Hogg’s
window, the postman’s baby had croup, or a party
of motorists had stopped to tea at “The Beetle”&mdash;never
once mentioned my experience, but kept it
locked up in my heart; yes, even from Tossie, who
brought all her joys and sorrows to me. Behold my
first secret! After all how puny and insignificant;
nevertheless, I hugged it like a child with her first
doll! On Slacklands Flats I had encountered a
good-looking stranger&mdash;no doubt one of the guns
at Myson&mdash;who had stared hard, looked after me,
and signalled a gay greeting. “Ships that pass
in the night”&mdash;“a couple who pass at sundown.”
I must confess that I allowed my mind to
dwell on the adventure as I sewed, as I listened
to the professor’s plays, yes, even in church, when
naturally I ought to have been engrossed in holy
thoughts and the rector’s short, crisp sermon.</p>

<span>A DANCE AT “THE PLOUGH”</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> Christmas my relations departed to Nice.
Aunt Mina, who suffered from bronchitis, went in
search of a little sun, my cousins in quest of amusement.
The Riviera was gay, and they were by all
accounts a large and congenial party. Perhaps their
consciences may have troubled them with regard
to me, for they sent me unusually nice presents&mdash;a
large box of chocolate, a fan, and a gay parasol.
There was not much occasion for these latter at Beke
in winter time, but one must not look a gift-horse in the
mouth! Our Christmas was profoundly dull, not to
say depressing; it was cold work decorating the
bleak old church&mdash;assisted by Lizzie, the schoolmistress,
the landlady of “The Beetle,” and many
others, including Tossie and her most recent admirer,
a smart young “vet” from Newmarket.</p>

<p>As we pricked our frozen hands and made a great
holly wreath for the font she said,</p>

<p>“You look awfully down, dear, and I suppose
there is no fun going on at ‘The Roost’ on Christmas
Day&mdash;no party, eh?”</p>

<p>“Need you ask?” I retorted derisively. “We
are to have early dinner, as Clarice has a holiday, and
the professor indigestion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<p>“You will be getting a letter from your brother
to cheer you. My! he is the best-looking fellow I
ever saw, although he <i>is</i> on the small side; I admire
his whole style, his neat little moustache, and the
lovely scent on his hair. Only that the others are so
pressing I would wait for him, I declare I would.”
And Tossie burst into a loud laugh. “See now, listen,
Evie, I have a splendid plan for you.”</p>

<p>“A plan?” I echoed.</p>

<p>“Yes, give me over that ball of twine, and I will
tell you all about it. On New Year’s Eve there is to
be a grand kick-up at ‘The Plough and Harrow’ in
Mirfield village; it is an hotel that was a fine place
in old times, and has a great big room at the back,
where they used to have routs, and soirées&mdash;whatever
they were. The inn is getting up a dance;
tickets half a crown for ladies, and I have got
yours.”</p>

<p>“As if Lizzie would allow me to go!”</p>

<p>“Wait now,” urged Tossie impressively; “the
company will be extra respectable, just farmer folk;
there will be a piano and a fiddle, and a bit of supper,
tea, and coffee and sandwiches. Mother is sending
the soup, and she will chaperon us. We will have
the top put on the old wagonette, which will hold six
inside, and you must come and dine and sleep at the
Manor, as you have done before of a wet night. I
know you are mad keen on dancing. They say the
floor is splendid, and you won’t mind with whom you
dance, so long as he is sober and a good partner&mdash;so
say you will come?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, you may be sure I shall, if Lizzie will let
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother Lizzie! You must assert yourself,
Evie, and not allow people to walk over you. It is all
very well for <i>her</i> to be living in Beke; she is forty
and has all she wants, and enjoys playing about the
parish with the rector. You just talk up to her
and say you intend to have a little fling. I am sure
she will see it. Liz has been young herself, and she
is awfully fond of you.”</p>

<p>“Who are your party?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Freddy Block the vet, and I am sure <i>he</i> looks
good enough for any society; my cousin Bob from
Leeds, he is in a big outfitter’s; Annie Green, Dr.
Mercer, Mother, brother Sam, and ourselves. It
will be rather a crowd, but Sam can go outside.”</p>

<p>“Tossie, it is too kind of you, and I should love
to go. I have not been to a dance since I left school,
and I will fall on my knees to Lizzie&mdash;but what about
my frock?”</p>

<p>“Oh, your black will do elegantly, and stick a bit
of mistletoe in your hair! Now mind you don’t disappoint
me, but try to get hold of Liz when she
feels Christmassy and soft.”</p>

<p>I believe Lizzie was a little sorry for me on
Christmas Day; my letters and cards had been so
few and there was nothing from India. The drawing-room
fire smoked, the turkey was nearly raw, the
groaning professor had retired upstairs; on the
whole we had a miserable festival.</p>

<p>The village itself wore a convivial air, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
my post in a deep-seated window I commanded a
view of the street, and enviously noted the many
cheery couples and families passing to and fro.
From my niche I was summoned by Lizzie; according
to immemorial custom the school-children were
to have a treat on Boxing Day, and I was bound
to lend a hand with the preparations. Accordingly,
I spent the remainder of the holiday helping to
ticket presents&mdash;taking care to see that there was
no cause for jealousy or rivalry in their distribution;
for instance, that the Cobbs received nothing that
might outshine the Bolters, that little Tommy Ware
was <i>not</i> endowed with a knife, or the “Beetle” baby
with a box of paints. With unscrupulous subtlety
I seized upon this exceptional opportunity, as my
confederate had advised, to “talk up to Lizzie.”</p>

<p>“Lizzie,” I began, “I am still legally what is
called an infant, and <i>I</i> should like a treat, too!”</p>

<p>“I only wish I could see my way to your having
one, my poor child,” she replied, “I know this is
a deadly existence for you, and I realise that
you do have a <i>very</i> poor time, but what is the
alternative?”</p>

<p>“We need not discuss that now, Liz, but the
treat is to hand; the Plough and Harrow Inn, at Mirfield,
is giving a dance on New Year’s Eve, it will
be quite a respectable affair, with a piano, a fiddle
and sandwiches. Mrs. Soady will chaperon me. Do
let me go, my dear Lizzie,” and I seized her by
the arm, “let me just have one dance, to circulate
my blood, and try to feel like other girls!” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
paused, and hung almost breathless on her answer.
It was a long time in coming, but at last she said,</p>

<p>“Well, of course, the Soadys are all right, but
they are not in your class, nor are their friends.”</p>

<p>“Now you are talking exactly like Aunt Mina!
Never mind the classes&mdash;I should like to dance with
the masses.”</p>

<p>“Oh Eva,” and as she spoke her face seemed to
lengthen by inches, “what <i>would</i> your aunt say?”</p>

<p>“She will never know,” I rejoined with easy
confidence, “and you might not have known either.
If I had just gone to dine and sleep at the Manor,
you would not dream in your wildest moments that
I was dancing the New Year in at the Plough and
Harrow, in Mirfield. You see, it is five miles from
here, and quite out of our beat; not a soul will recognise
me. But I could not play you such a trick, Liz&mdash;whatever
I am, I am not sly!”</p>

<p>“Well, I really do not know what to say,”
declared Lizzie sitting down with a Noah’s Ark in
her lap. “I halt between two opinions. On the one
hand, I should like you to enjoy yourself and have
a little bit of amusement for once; on the other,
I must say I rather shrink from the idea of your
making your debut, chaperoned by old Mother
Soady, and dancing with such partners as Sam
and Bob Tate. If you do go&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here I broke in,</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear good Lizzie, and I shall have no
end of funny things to tell you afterwards.”</p>

<p>“If you do go,” she reiterated, “the whole thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
must be a dead secret; above all, not a word to
Uncle Sep; he <i>talks</i>&mdash;and when he went over to
‘The Beetle’ for tobacco he would tell the village
all about it; it is also to be a dead secret from <i>me</i>.
Understand, that I give you permission to dine and
sleep at the Manor; however they may entertain
you there is no longer my affair.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Liz, what a nice Jesuitical way of looking
at it! But whatever happens I have your official
consent.” Then I fell upon her and kissed her.</p>

<p>We certainly were a tight fit, and a noisy party,
in the old wagonette, which was somewhat severely
tried by the weight of the company and the slap-dash
pace of a fine pair of young horses. Nevertheless, we
arrived safely at the “Plough and Harrow,” and in
capital time. The old inn was all lit up, spectators
were crowding round the door, gigs, phaetons and
even milk carts were depositing happy guests. The
ladies’ cloakroom was crammed; here we unpinned,
uncloaked and reported upon one another’s appearance,
as there was not the smallest chance of approaching
the one looking-glass. Tossie looked
blooming in blue and white. Annie Green was in
flowered muslin of a bold and lurid design&mdash;somewhat
resembling a perambulating wall-paper. The
style, she informed us, “was the very latest thing
in Paris.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Soady, chiefly remarkable for her kind
heart and her circumference, was dressed in her best
black satin, which was many inches too short in
front, a large plaid bow crowned her good-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
smiling face, and an enormous cameo brooch fastened
under her chin imparted the effect of a martingale.</p>

<p>As soon as we had emerged from the struggling
mass of women in the cloakroom we were joined
by our cavaliers; thus supported, as we entered the
ballroom in a body, I was sensible of an atmosphere
of delicious adventure! The ballroom was long,
narrow, and wainscoted, and held a powerful atmosphere
of potatoes&mdash;no wonder, since, as Sam informed
me, several tons of this useful root had
been but recently removed.</p>

<p>It was illuminated by wall lamps, and profusely
garlanded with Christmas greenery. At one end was
the band (piano, flute and violin), and the first set
of lancers was promptly arranged. There were
few forms for sitting out, as most of the company
were young and meant business; in other words,
they had come to dance&mdash;and dance they did! I
found myself as a partner in flattering demand. I
waltzed with Doctor Mercer, who bore me round in a
series of leaps and bounds; the next waltz was with
the “vet,” a most creditable performer; then I danced
with young Sam, who gambolled about like a clumsy
colt, talking all the time at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>I was resting after my second waltz with Mr. Block,
the vet, when he drew my attention to two men who
were contemplating the scene from an opposite doorway.
They were in shooting dress; one I had never
seen before, but instantly I recognised his companion
as “the stranger.” The couple had evidently
just looked in casually, to see what was going on, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
had happened upon a most animated gathering.
There could be no possible doubt of the company’s
enjoyment.</p>

<p>“You see those two fellows over there?” said
my partner, “they are officers stopping here for the
duck shooting.”</p>

<p>Almost before he had ceased speaking, I beheld
the stranger dodging about among the dancers. He
came straight up to me, bowed, and said,</p>

<p>“May I have the honour of a dance?”</p>

<p>In for a penny in for a pound! Without a
moment’s hesitation I replied,</p>

<p>“Yes, with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“The next?”</p>

<p>I was engaged to the local telegraph clerk for the
next. Should I throw him over? No.</p>

<p>“I can give you number twelve,” I said looking
at my card.</p>

<p>“I say, and what about <i>me</i>?” clamoured the
stranger’s companion, who had now joined us, clicking
his heels together and bowing before me with exaggerated
respect.</p>

<p>Somehow I did not feel favourably disposed
towards this would-be partner; he had not, like
his friend, an arresting personality. I disliked his
prominent nose and teeth and bold goggling eyes,
and fixed him with my best imitation of Aunt
Mina’s glare.</p>

<p>“But why should I be left out?” he argued, totally
unabashed; “you have given him one, and you dance
like an angel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p>“This lady and I have met before,” coolly interposed
the stranger. Then to me, “I shall look
forward to number twelve”; and taking the other
forcibly by the arm, he removed him from my
vicinity. Subsequently, as I swam round the room
in the charge of the telegraph clerk, I noticed the
two watching us closely from the doorway, and as
soon as the waltz was over I was promptly claimed.</p>

<p>My new partner danced admirably, our step
suited, the floor was in first-rate condition, and the
old “Amoureuse” was one of my favourites.</p>

<p>“Why do you try to steer?” inquired my partner,
when we halted.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” I replied, “but I suppose it is
because, being one of the tall girls, I always danced
gentleman at school.”</p>

<p>“And since?”</p>

<p>“This is my first dance&mdash;elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Then I am afraid your people must live in a
desperately dull neighbourhood?”</p>

<p>“I do not live with my people,” I replied, “in
fact, I may tell you, I have no people to live with.
My parents died when I was quite small, and my
only brother is in India.” I paused abruptly, and
felt myself growing red with self-consciousness. Why
should I offer all this autobiography to an absolute
stranger? What were my affairs to him? As
usual my tongue had run away with me, and I felt
stricken with confusion and remorse.</p>

<p>After a short silence, he said,</p>

<p>“Possibly you may not remember me, but we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
passed one another on the marshes some time ago.
I was so astonished to see a young lady walking alone
in that dreary side of the country, I might have
thought you were an apparition but for the dog. Do
you live in that part of the world?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “within a few miles.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Soady, passing by on the arm of the doctor,
patted me on the arm and said,</p>

<p>“Come along and get some soup before it’s all
gone. I hope you are enjoying yourself, dearie?”</p>

<p>I nodded an emphatic assent, and as she disappeared
in the direction of refreshments my companion
looked at me interrogatively.</p>

<p>“My chaperon,” I briefly explained.</p>

<p>“I see,” he assented, nevertheless it was evident
that he was greatly puzzled. He surveyed my neat
black frock, my well-fitting gloves, my beautiful
French fan&mdash;also perhaps my smart satin shoes and
silk stockings, which were crossed in front of me,
for I never made any secret of the fact that I had
remarkably pretty feet.</p>

<p>After this we talked perfunctorily of the weather
and of dogs; presently he conducted me to the
buffet in the hotel dining-room, where, as I stood
sipping coffee, I noticed that many eyes were upon
us, including those of the landlady. To this attention
I was serenely indifferent; beyond our own
party not a soul in the room, or among the company,
had the least idea as to who I was, or that
they were honoured by the presence of the great
granddaughter of a duke! After a very short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
“interval for refreshments,” we returned to the
ballroom and danced two delightful waltzes; as the
last sad strain sobbed itself to an end, my companion
said:</p>

<p>“I am aware that we have become acquainted in
rather an unusual fashion. Would you think me
awfully presumptuous if I were to ask you to tell
me your name?” I nodded my head with, I fear,
ungracious emphasis. “I see,” he exclaimed. “Well,
all right&mdash;then I shall call you Miss Incognita. Mine
is Captain Falkland&mdash;Brian Falkland.”</p>

<p>“I see,” I echoed. I cannot imagine what
possessed me to mimic him to his face. I felt “fey,”
the dancing had exhilarated me, and had gone to my
head like champagne.</p>

<p>“This is a queer old inn,” he went on. “The
landlady told me that ages ago all the county came
here, and in winter had routs in this room. I should
say it had <a name="routs" id="routs"></a><ins title="Original has ‘roots’">routs</ins> within the last week,” and he
sniffed fastidiously.</p>

<p>At this moment Sam, breathless from his exertions,
mopping his big, red face, accosted me.</p>

<p>“Sorry to interrupt, Miss Eva,” he panted;
“Mother sent me to look for you. It is after one
o’clock and we ought to be getting home,” and
turning apologetically to my partner he added: “You
see, sir, we farmers are bound to be early folk.”</p>

<p>“So sorry,” said my companion; “I suppose
there is no help for it; you must go, but I will only
say au revoir, Miss Eva,” and he bowed.</p>

<p>Still possessed by the spirit of giddiness, I made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
him a profound court curtsy, such as had possibly
been executed in the adjacent ballroom a hundred
and fifty years previously, and then I walked off
attended by Sam. Ten minutes later, when our
loud and hilarious party had all been packed into
the “Black Maria,” I noticed Captain Falkland and
his friend standing on the steps of the “Plough
and Harrow,” watching our proceedings with unaffected
interest, until our high-spirited horses
whirled us away into the darkness of the January
night.</p>

<p>On our arrival at the Manor, Tossie followed me
into my room for “a talk”; as we unhooked one
another, and so to speak disarmed, naturally we discussed
the dance.</p>

<p>“I need not ask you if you enjoyed yourself,”
she said, “you were quite the beauty. And it was a
real treat to see you and that officer dancing together;
a good partner, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “he holds you so comfortably,
and always seems to know where he is going.”</p>

<p>“And you did have what they call a ‘success,’
my dear; everyone was asking who you were, and
I told them, a friend from London, who is stopping
with me; one may as well tell a good lie when one
goes about it. Did you not feel for all the world
like a swan in a duck pond?”</p>

<p>“No, but a goose&mdash;and very much a goose.”</p>

<p>Before Tossie retired to her own apartment she
became most confidential and interesting, and informed
me that Fred Block had been on the verge of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
proposal, but she had headed him off as she could not
yet make up her mind.</p>

<p>“As for you,” she added, “I was very ‘mum’
when they were chaffing you in the bus about your
best partner&mdash;I believe you gave him five waltzes. I
know all about him, and they don’t; shall I tell you?”</p>

<p>“If you like,” I answered with affected nonchalance.</p>

<p>“Don’t drawl,” protested Tossie, “be interested
or you shan’t hear a word.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on, I am all ears.”</p>

<p>“Then listen. Captain Falkland is in some
cavalry regiment. He has been staying at Landmere
for Christmas with the Earl and Countess of Runnymede,
his cousins; it is said they want him to marry
Lady Amelia, a plain, washed-out thing with weak
eyes. He is the only son of General and Lady Louisa
Falkland&mdash;awfully proud people&mdash;and is very good-looking,
as you may see; I do love the nice way his
hair grows down over his square forehead&mdash;I should
like to see you married to him, so I would!” and
Tossie gave me a playful push.</p>

<p>“I never heard such nonsense!” I exclaimed.
“It is not the least likely we shall ever meet again.”</p>

<p>“Then you did not give him a little clue, or tell
him your name?” and Tossie thrust her red-and-white
face close to mine, and stared into my eyes
with her unflinching blue orbs.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” I answered impatiently. “Why
should I?”</p>

<p>“If it had been <i>me</i>, I’d have done it! Well now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
there is three striking and I must go to my bed. The
meet is at Harper’s Cross at eleven&mdash;but you can
sleep it out!”</p>

<p>On my return from the Manor to “The Roost,” I
related to Lizzie the history of my illegitimate outing.
With more than usual glibness my tongue wagged
freely, as I described the dance, the supper, the
music, the most notable costumes, and my various
partners&mdash;all except one; and she, kind and unsuspicious
creature, declared that she was delighted
to hear I had enjoyed myself so thoroughly, but
added:</p>

<p>“If the tidings of this little escapade were ever to
reach the ears of Mrs. Lingard, I believe I should
be compelled to <i>emigrate</i>!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_5">CHAPTER V<br />
<span>THE GREAT INVASION</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is strange but true that my future lot was profoundly
affected by the microbe of influenza. Influenza
accomplishes various evils; this obnoxious
germ carries weakness, depression and death, but it
is rare to find it a medium that launches a young
woman into the great wide world.</p>

<p>An excursion to London every January was one
of the hard-and-fast rules of “The Roost”; about the
middle of the month, when Christmas festivities
had waned, the professor and his niece journeyed together
to a boarding-house in Bayswater, and there
enjoyed&mdash;each in their own way&mdash;a fortnight of the
Metropolis. She, in attending sales and classical
concerts, looking up old friends and going to “teas”
arrayed in her best clothes. He, in personally worrying
managers and dramatic agents, patronising
theatres, telephoning incessantly, and giving expensive
entertainments to needy professionals, who
fed his insatiable vanity with enormous helpings of
the sweetest flattery, and sent him back to his dull
old den with a swollen head and a somewhat empty
pocket.</p>

<p>Just before this half-yearly expedition, when
rooms had been engaged, luggage packed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
our arrival formally notified, Lizzie suddenly collapsed
under a violent attack of “flu.” As her temperature
was found to be 103, a journey was out of the question.
The doctor who was summoned ordered bed
and nursing, and declared the ailment to be of a particularly
virulent type. Lizzie, painfully distressed
and apologetic, endeavoured to assert herself and
talked of “being all right in a couple of days,” but
when the doctor uttered the word “pneumonia”
she succumbed.</p>

<p>At first the attitude of the professor was sympathetic,
then by degrees he became silent, sullen,
and finally morose; as vexed at his postponed holidays
as any spoilt child.</p>

<p>“But I thought you hated London,” I said, not
sorry to tease him a little. “You have always said
you were so thankful to live outside the noise and
clamour of the world.”</p>

<p>My remarks irritated the professor to such a
degree that I believe he could have thrown a book
at me had one been handy, but they had merely
the effect of inflaming his passion for the great
city with its vast opportunities.</p>

<p>“Why not let him go alone?” I suggested to the
invalid. “He says the rooms will have to be paid for,
and he is miserable about all the important appointments
he is missing. If you could look out of the
window, you would see him raging up and down the
garden.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I know,” said Lizzie impatiently, “he
always does that when he’s put out. Somehow I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
am reluctant to let Uncle Sep out of my sight, especially
in London; he does crazy, impulsive things
and is so easily talked into follies, such as spending
and lending, and I act as a sort of brake; then those
chattering elderly women at Number 20 make no
end of him and imply that he is quite a lady-killer
and irresistibly attractive. Poor Uncle Sep never
was either; clever enough, but not very wise,
especially since he slipped on a banana and fell on
the back of his head. You say he is dull and
disappointed?”</p>

<p>“‘Dull and disappointed’ but feebly conveys
the case! He is like Kipper when he sees me with
my hat on, frantic to go out. He ate no dinner last
night.”</p>

<p>“Then, indeed, he is in a bad way! Well, ask
him to saturate himself with eucalyptus, and to come
and talk it all over with me after lunch.”</p>

<p>The result of this talk was the departure of the
professor the very next morning. He made an almost
imposing figure in his London clothes, tall hat,
frock coat, neat umbrella, and modern boots. As
I escorted him to the little gate he remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, Evie, <i>this</i> time I shall do something with
the managers. I have a presentiment that I shall
bring back a huge success.”</p>

<p>“Only it’s so cold I’d throw my shoe after you,”
I replied, “but I wish you the best of luck.”</p>

<p>Without any further remark, or even the formality
of a farewell, he climbed into the creaking fly and
was presently lumbering away. Lizzie’s illness lasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
longer than we anticipated; she kept her room
for nearly three weeks; meanwhile, village and
parochial business was more or less dislocated. Mr.
Chesterfield the rector called daily and sent flowers,
newspapers, and notes, but never approached the
infected premises nearer than a hundred yards.</p>

<p>At last the ruler of “The Roost” crawled downstairs,
a weak and shattered remnant of her keen and
energetic self. However, the “sofa,” and “feeding up”
were duly prescribed, with excellent results. Letters
from the professor&mdash;once so copious&mdash;had lately
degenerated into picture postcards, and these chiefly
conveyed bulletins of the weather. He had been absent
nearly a month, and to me this was a happy relief.
Lizzie was now convalescent, and once more
managing Beke with her accustomed capability.</p>

<p>One afternoon we were returning from a long
and muddy walk, when a boy darted out of the
post office, and handed her a telegram. It came
from Uncle Sep, and said, “Arrive to-night, send
fly to the seven; have good fires and dinner.”</p>

<p>“What a funny telegram!” she exclaimed
handing it to me; “as if we don’t always have fires
and a good dinner. As it happens, there is a goose
to-night. I will tell Eliza to make a roly-poly and
Welsh rarebit&mdash;Uncle Sep loves them&mdash;and also to
put a big fire in his bedroom. I expect he’s had a
play accepted, and wishes to commemorate his return
with a feast.”</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o’clock when I heard the
fly stop at the front gate. I had been listening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
expectantly; even the return of the tiresome professor
made a change in my monotonous existence.
He would bring, if not news, at least some illustrated
papers. I went into the hall and looked
out; it was a cold, dark night, with drifting showers
of sleet; nevertheless, I stood bravely at the open
door, whilst Clarice, with the skirt of her dress flung
over her head, pattered down to the cab. The professor
descended heavily backwards, and instead of
as usual hurrying indoors, he turned about, apparently
in order to assist another to alight&mdash;a woman!
In a second I divined the truth. Uncle Sep had
brought home a wife!</p>

<p>Naturally a desperate moral coward, he had
shrunk from announcing the marriage to his niece,
and left it to the bride to break the intelligence in
person. I dashed into the dining-room, where
Lizzie was deliberately lighting candles on the
mantelpiece, and gasped out:</p>

<p>“Your uncle has brought someone back with him&mdash;I
think it is Mrs. Bickers!”</p>

<p>Lizzie turned about, and stood staring at me
stupidly, her mouth half open&mdash;a lighted taper in her
unconscious hand. I remembered Mrs. Bickers at
the boarding-house, a plump widow of fifty with a
strongly corseted figure, black eyes like boot buttons,
a high colour, and a long chin.</p>

<p>Yes, I was right, it <i>was</i> Mrs. Bickers! Already she
was standing in the doorway, clad in a black waterproof
and an aggressive-looking hat covered with
pointed wings. The cowardly professor pushed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
into the room before him, saying in a loud, would-be
jovial voice:</p>

<p>“Hallo, Liz, I have brought you a present from
London. Here is your new aunt and old friend,
Mrs. Bickers&mdash;now Mrs. Puckle. We were married
ten days ago!”</p>

<p>The announcement was succeeded by a prolonged
and dramatic silence. For my part, my nerves were
throbbing with excitement, and it may appear
callous and hard-hearted, but personally I felt as
if I were witnessing a powerful scene in some play.
The atmosphere seemed to be charged with animosity
and fear; fear being well represented by Uncle
Sep, who was breathing audibly in quick short
gasps; animosity had sprung to arms within the eyes
of the two ladies.</p>

<p>“My dear Lizzie,” said Mrs. Puckle; then suddenly
advancing upon her and seizing her unawares
she attacked her with a vigorous embrace.</p>

<p>“Well, Uncle,” said Lizzie, releasing herself as
vigorously, and straightening her back; “you <i>have</i>
indeed given us a surprise!”</p>

<p>I knew that Lizzie was furious, wild with indignation
and consternation, but years of governessing
had taught her extraordinary self-control.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, life is full of surprises,” said the
professor, to whom things seemed to be going unexpectedly
well. “I hope there is a good fire in my
room,” he added bumptiously. “Jessie,” to the
bride, “you will like to take your things off, and
we will have dinner at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” she answered obediently. “Dear
me, how warm and cosy it all looks!” and the
bride’s quick eyes travelled round the room, and
noted the solid mahogany furniture, the massive
table appointments, and the whole appearance of
unostentatious comfort. On her way towards the
door she halted and addressed herself particularly
to Lizzie.</p>

<p>“Your uncle and I were always friendly you
remember, and a fortnight’s propinquity was too
much for us both!”</p>

<p>“Was it really?” rejoined Lizzie, speaking
with set lips, and a bright red spot on either cheek.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the bride, “we have so much
in common, and are both old enough to know our
own minds.” And then she turned her broad back
on her new niece, and passed into the hall.</p>

<p>“This I suppose is the drawing-room?” And
the bride threw open the door and stood in a “monarch
of all I survey” attitude on the threshold.
Within, it looked black and aggressively forbidding;
it was as if the spirit of the old house distrusted
this stranger.</p>

<p>“Oh dear me, what a horrible smell of damp
and dry rot! I shall have a fire in here every day.”</p>

<p>Having made this announcement, Mrs. Puckle
closed the door with emphasis, and mounted the
stairs.</p>

<p>The landing was already piled with luggage&mdash;bags,
baskets, battered cardboard boxes, and shabby
trunks. Lizzie conducted her supplanter to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
quarters with exaggerated ceremony&mdash;even dissembling
her feelings so far as to get out fresh
towels and the best scented soap&mdash;and having been
told to order dinner to be ready in ten minutes’
time, she flew down to me.</p>

<p>As the craven and base professor was a refugee
in his den, Lizzie and I had the dining-room to
ourselves.</p>

<p>“So for once he <i>did</i> mind telling!” I began.</p>

<p>“Eva, how can you joke?” she interrupted
indignantly; “I was wrong to let him go alone, but
influenza makes one such a worm, not only weak in
body but in mind, otherwise I never would have consented
to this trip to London&mdash;a most fatal excursion
for him. Mrs. Bickers is the worst, most catty, and
pushing of all the widows. I believe she is penniless
and has just flattered herself into this comfortable
home.” Then to Clarice who had entered gaping,
“Clarice, your master was married ten days ago;
let Eliza know.”</p>

<p>“Eliza, she do know,” was the prompt reply.
“She says the master be daft!”</p>

<p>A stealthy rustle on the stairs interrupted Clarice,
who hurried out, only to return almost immediately
with the soup tureen and evidently prepared to
enjoy a good leisurely stare at the stranger&mdash;a sleek,
complacent matron, wearing a pink satin blouse and
a large lace collar, fastened by a new-looking diamond
brooch.</p>

<p>Seating herself at the head of the table and seizing
the soup ladle, Mrs. Puckle said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll just sit here, Lizzie dear, I know you won’t
mind, and begin to take over at once&mdash;it saves trouble.”</p>

<p>Lizzie’s answer was a bow as she placed herself
opposite to me; the professor now appeared and,
with assumed geniality, announced that he was
“starving.”</p>

<p>I noticed that his appearance was considerably
improved. He wore a glossy white shirt, his hair
and beard had been trimmed&mdash;also his nails.</p>

<p>“Well, Lizzie,” he began, blinking his eyelids&mdash;sure
sign of nervousness&mdash;“I thought I’d do something
to get out of the rut. Beke is such a stick-in-the-mud
sort of place, eh? I suppose <i>this</i> is the surprise
of your life?”</p>

<p>“Well, Uncle, I confess it is&mdash;so far&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘Happy the wooing that’s not long a doing,’
and you know we had no one to consult. We shall
all shake down together, eh? The more the merrier.
It’s a fine big house. I remember hearing that old
Elias Puckle, who lived here eighty years ago, had a
family of fifteen children!”</p>

<p>“How many bedrooms?” inquired the bride in
her brusquest manner.</p>

<p>“About eight,” I replied, now thrusting myself
into the conversation, as Lizzie seemed to be temporarily
dumb. “Not counting the servants’ rooms,
garrets, and cellars.”</p>

<p>“You are not thinking of taking P.G.’s?” put
in the professor jocosely.</p>

<p>“No, no, darling, of course not.”</p>

<p>To hear the professor addressed as “darling”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
was altogether too much for my gravity. I choked,
and then stooped for an imaginary handkerchief to
hide my smiles.</p>

<p>“Have you done anything about your plays?”
I asked as soon as I had recovered my usual composure.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I have everything in capital train now;
the missis there has interest, she has relations on the
boards. We expect great things from ‘The Termagant,’
don’t we, ducky?”</p>

<p>“Of course we do; it will be an enormous
success,” she answered, speaking as it were in
capital letters. “Recognition has been a long time
in coming to the dear professor, has it not?”</p>

<p>As she spoke, Mrs. Puckle fastened her eyes on me;
undoubtedly she had heard of “the readings.”</p>

<p>“Most geniuses have had the same painful
experiences. Shakespeare, by all accounts, had little
honour in his own day, and think of poor dear Chatterton!
It’s my belief&mdash;and I know what I’m
talking about&mdash;that the professor’s plays will be
acclaimed by packed houses yet&mdash;his name and fame
will be world-wide.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Puckle’s manner was distinctly challenging,
I meekly murmured:</p>

<p>“I hope so, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>The lady now proceeded to criticise, dissect, and
destroy the reputations of the leading dramatic
authors of the day. She talked ceaselessly; evidently
she was talking for talking’s sake, in order
to counteract Lizzie’s gloomy silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<p>After the professor had swallowed a second
strong tumbler of whisky and water, he ventured
to draw his niece into the conversation; under the
circumstances her composure was extraordinary.
I sat amazed, as she unfolded parish happenings
and domestic news, as if totally unconscious that a
stranger had suddenly descended on her home and
usurped her position. Meanwhile, I observed the
new aunt carefully examining the forks and spoons
and turning them about to discover the hall-mark.
Satisfied that they were mostly old Georgian silver,
she proceeded to cross-examine me.</p>

<p>“So you live at ‘The Roost’ altogether, Miss
Lingard?”</p>

<p>“For the present&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“And are you <i>really</i> related to the Lingards of
Torrington?” she inquired condescendingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Lingard is my uncle.”</p>

<p>“And Miss Lingard who is to marry Sir Beaufort
Finsbury is your cousin?”</p>

<p>I nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Torrington Park is quite a large place, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I admitted, “it is rather large.”</p>

<p>“How many servants do they keep?”</p>

<p>“I really do not know.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it seem rather a pity that you cannot
live with your own relations?”</p>

<p>This was a nasty one for me, and for the moment
I could not think of any effective reply.</p>

<p>“And you,” firing a shot at Lizzie, “were the
governess at Torrington&mdash;nursery, or otherwise?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>To this impertinent question there was no
rejoinder.</p>

<p>By this time the goose, pudding, savoury and
cheese had been disposed of, and having dined satisfactorily,
and figuratively shown her teeth, Mrs.
Puckle made a move. Addressing the professor, she
said:</p>

<p>“As I am rather tired, darling, I’ll go up early
and unpack. Don’t be long, and don’t smoke more
than one pipe.”</p>

<p>“All right, ducky,” he assented, then rising with
remarkable agility and pushing back his chair, he
retired to the security afforded by his den. It
amused me to see how desperately he was afraid of
being left alone with us; possibly he was troubled by
an uneasy conscience.</p>

<p>As soon as the happy pair had departed, Lizzie
rang the bell for Clarice, but for once the bell was
answered by Eliza, who came to inform us that
“Clarice was upstairs with the mistress, unpacking
her boxes.” Having made this announcement she
began to collect the dinner things as if she bore them
a vicious personal spite. Eliza, like Lizzie, was in
moments of emotional stress a woman of few words,
and whilst she crashed crockery Lizzie was busy
scribbling a note at the bureau, which, when finished
and folded, she handed to our retainer and said:</p>

<p>“Just run over with this to the rectory, Eliza;
there is no answer.”</p>

<p>“And how would I run that am bent in two
with the rheumatics?” demanded Eliza in a queru<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>lous
tone. “One run I’ll make, and it’s out of this
house&mdash;I know the class of that one, so I do.”</p>

<p>“That is enough, Eliza,” said Lizzie with dignity.
“Come, Eva, there is a good fire in my room.”</p>

<p>As soon as I was seated in a comfortable easy
chair I flung out my arms and exclaimed: “What
a dinner! I declare there was a smell of gunpowder
in the air! Tell me, Liz, what you are going to do?
I know you have some plan&mdash;I see it in your eye.”</p>

<p>“We leave here to-morrow,” she announced
with curt decision.</p>

<p>“Oh! Not really?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she proceeded, “to stay at the rectory
as a sort of <i>pied-à-terre</i>. I made up my mind about
everything before that woman had been in the
house five minutes. You shall go to Torrington.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Lizzie,” I protested, “anywhere but
Torrington. Do you know it is a fact, that when I
was last there I used to lie awake at night for <i>hours</i>
hating Aunt Mina? Besides, they won’t have me,”
I concluded triumphantly.</p>

<p>“But they must,” she answered, with an air of
serene resolution. “I no longer have a suitable
home to offer you. I intend to move up to London
and take a small flat.”</p>

<p>“And leave Mrs. Puckle monarch of all she
surveys?”</p>

<p>“By no means,” deliberately turning up her
skirt and placing a pair of neat black velvet shoes
upon the fender. “Uncle Sep has misled her. She
believes that the house and money are exclusively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
his, and is not aware that the half of everything
belongs to me. I shall consult my solicitor, value,
remove and store my portion of the furniture, let half
‘The Roost,’ and take my share of <i>all</i>&mdash;yes, to the
ultimate egg spoon!”</p>

<p>“Will you?” I ejaculated. “What fun!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Mrs. Puckle will not see the humour
of the situation, but find herself bitterly disappointed.
With our united incomes, and your
hundred a year, Uncle Sep and I were almost rich.
Now he will be obliged to economise. I am sorry
for Uncle Sep. I have always understood that Mrs.
Puckle, who was penniless, contrived to make herself
so agreeable to Mrs. Williams at Number 20 that
she kept her on as useful help, advertiser and toady!
I believe she has two ne’er-do-well sons and a married
daughter, and no doubt will accommodate them all
at ‘The Roost.’ Poor Uncle!”</p>

<p>To which adjuration I added a fervent “Amen.”</p>

<p>“I shall be sorry to part with you, dear child,”
continued Lizzie, “but you are sensible for your
age and have your wits about you, and it is time
you put out from the shore; your aunt cannot refuse
a harbour, and, with a favouring breeze, I believe
your little skiff will go far. As for me, I shall have
my freedom; I have saved, and in London I shall
breathe freely among people of my own tastes. Well,
we can do the rest of our talking at the rectory, for
now I must pack. I intend to make an early flitting.
Jones will cart over our boxes in the wheelbarrow,
and, as I have a great deal to gather and sort, I expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
to be up all night. You, my dear child, have only
your clothes and books, so it will not be a long business,
but go and set about it at once, and good night.”</p>

<p>The next morning we found ourselves comfortably
installed at the rectory, Lizzie encompassed with
the results of many trips by wheelbarrow; and here,
when her flight was discovered, she received the visit
and onslaught of her aunt and uncle. But they found
the fugitive firmly entrenched behind facts and will
power; no alluring invitations would induce her
to return to “The Roost” and “go shares.” She
was excessively polite but immovable, and her
visitors were compelled to retreat in obvious confusion&mdash;the
professor dazed and pallid, his bride on
the contrary with a beetroot complexion, and seething
over with suppressed passion.</p>

<p>Soon after their departure the dog Kipper arrived;
formally dispatched in charge of the gardener,
accompanied by his luggage so to speak&mdash;bowl, basket,
coat and lead; to intimate that he was absolutely
expelled from “The Roost.”</p>

<p>And now the question arose, what was to be done
with him? The rector&mdash;most selfish of men&mdash;flatly
refused him a home, declaring that he was too old
for a dog, and that his personal cat was elderly
and a fixture. It was clear that Lizzie could not
have Kipper in her flat on possibly a fifth floor,
although there <i>was</i> a legend that, once upon a time,
a lady had maintained a duck in similar quarters!</p>

<p>“You shall take him, Evie,” she announced,
with an air of cool decision. “He was always your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
friend, and in a big place like Torrington one dog
more or less will never be noticed.”</p>

<p>“But I am confident that Aunt Mina won’t have
me,” I protested, “much less the dog.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes she will,” rejoined Lizzie with conviction;
“I know your aunt. I ought to, after living
under her roof for eight years. Whatever her feelings
are she studies appearances, and now that Dora
is going to be married there will be room for you
in the landau.”</p>

<p>My aunt’s invitation was somewhat tardy.
Before its arrival I made many farewell calls and
spent a whole day with the Soadys, where I received
(in confidence) the news of Tossie’s engagement to
Fred Block. She had made up her mind at last!
I was much interested, so also was the village, in
beholding great vans loading up in front of “The
Roost,” and subsequently carrying away Lizzie’s
share of the furniture. I also observed a large painted
board, stoutly planted in the front garden, on which
was announced “The Half of this House to be Let,
Eight Good Rooms. Apply at the Post Office.” The
vans and the advertisement gave our little community
plenty of topics for discussion.</p>

<p>Ultimately the “Beetle” fly transported Lizzie
and myself to the junction station, and the curtain
fell on Beke.</p>

<span>IN AUNT MINA’S SHOES</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the creaking, rumbling fly conversation had been
somewhat difficult, but when in a smooth-running
first-class carriage&mdash;which luckily we had to ourselves&mdash;Lizzie
and I enjoyed at last a heart-to-heart
talk. My aunt’s letter, so tardy in making its appearance,
had been cordial and even affectionate. She
no longer addressed me as if I were a naughty child,
but a full-grown human being, and even an intelligent
member of society! I drew her epistle from my
hand bag and glanced over it once more.</p>

<p>It was written from Claridge’s Hotel, and said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Eva</span>,&mdash;Do excuse my delay in writing
to you with respect to your future plans, but I have
been so busy, and so <i>rushed</i>, I’ve had scarcely a
moment to myself. I have heard from Lizzie of her
uncle’s most <i>disgraceful</i> and <i>insane</i> behaviour; how
she has been driven out of her comfortable home
by a penniless adventuress. Silly, irresponsible old
men such as the professor, should, in my opinion, be
placed under proper restraint. As ‘The Roost’ is
closed you will, of course, come to us and be one of
the family&mdash;at least, for a time. Lizzie has reminded
me that you are nearly twenty, and it is certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
desirable that you should come out and be presented,
but somehow you have always seemed younger than
your age. Girls shoot up so quickly and one forgets
how years fly.</p>

<p>“Professor Puckle’s aberration happens at a
most awkward moment. You have heard from
Dora of her engagement to Sir Beaumont Finsbury?
We are all <i>so</i> pleased. He is quite charming, and has
a lovely place in Sussex. A widower with one son,
and that is the worst that can be said of him! The
girls and myself are now in town getting the trousseau,
making arrangements for the wedding, and have such
hundreds of engagements, and so much to do, that
I am afraid we shall not be at Torrington for another
fortnight. However, your uncle is at home, and
you and he will have to entertain one another.
Unfortunately it is the dull time of the year (being
Lent), but I dare say you will find a steady animal to
ride, and you can always go and see dearest Mrs.
Paget-Taylor, she is so cheery and sociable. The
wedding will take place at Torrington early in April,
and of course you will be one of the bridemaids.
Post me a pattern, and I will order your dress at once.
Your cousins send their love,</p>

<p>
“Your affectionate aunt,<br />
“<span class="smcap">Wilhelmina Lingard</span>.”<br />
</p>

<p>“P.S.&mdash;I hope you have good news from Ronnie?”</p>
</div>

<p>“Quite a nice letter,” remarked Lizzie, as she
watched me folding it up. I noticed that her colour
had increased, and her eyes, like her uncle’s, were blink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>ing&mdash;invariably
a sign that she had something unpleasant
to disclose. She gave a little cough, and said,
“Now that all is so amicably arranged, I feel that
I am bound to tell you that at first your aunt was
anxious that you and I should not part company.”</p>

<p>I met her glance steadily and said:</p>

<p>“Then I presume that was the subject of all
those letters and sheets of telegrams?”</p>

<p>“It was,” admitted Lizzie; “she wished you
to share the flat, and urged that we were so accustomed
to one another, and so attached, etc. But I absolutely
declined, and said that the time had come when
you should take your place in society. In short, my
dear, I refused to be a party to shutting you up in
a flat with a middle-aged person like myself&mdash;you
must have your place in the sun.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I shall enjoy a place in the sun at
Torrington?” I asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>With my mind’s eye I read the whole correspondence
between Aunt Mina and my companion. My
aunt’s urgent desire to foist me upon Lizzie Puckle;
Lizzie’s equally firm determination to establish me
with my aunt. Possibly&mdash;nay probably&mdash;she had
been offered a handsome bribe; but both the bribe
and I had been declined. No doubt Lizzie had
acted in what she believed to be my best interests,
but the result left me rather sore. Apparently I was
wanted neither at Torrington nor in the flat!</p>

<p>“Well, at least a few gleams must fall on you when
Dora has become the Lady Finsbury; you will fill the
gap in the family! Your aunt will no doubt move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
heaven and earth to transfer you to a home of your
own. Perhaps you will be disposed of next season,
and I hope&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here I broke in angrily,</p>

<p>“If Aunt Mina attempts to make a match for
me I warn you that I shall run away. I can always
find a home with the Soadys.”</p>

<p>“My dear Eva, you shall never arrive at that
strait! Should you find Torrington unbearable you
must come and live with me. I shall take a flat with
a spare bedroom, and that will be, if the worst comes
to the worst, your haven of refuge. But I can’t help
thinking that you will settle down comfortably at
Torrington; you are a grown-up young woman
now and must be treated as such; and for your part
you will no longer give way to screaming fits of
passion, or to biting saucers! You must be sure
to write to me often, and tell me all your joys and
sorrows. And remember, my dear child, that in
any trouble or difficulty you may always look to
<i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>At a great junction sixty miles from London I
was obliged to change, and as we steamed into the
station, with a few words, many kisses and two or
three tears, I took leave of Lizzie. Here our life’s
pathway also parted; she, to lead at last a free
existence, and I, to enter once more my aunt’s
house of bondage.</p>

<p>I was met at our local station by a brougham and
a luggage cart, and was soon bowling along the frosty
country road. Torrington had splendid iron gates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
flanked by imposing lodges. The avenue was long,
and, so to speak, made the most of itself! About a
quarter of a mile from the entrance the house came into
view, but I felt no glow of joyful recognition; in
spite of a park, delightful gardens and clipped yew
hedges, I had little affection for the home of my
ancestors. With its blank white façade it gave me
the impression of some ghastly sinister face, peering
out from among the surrounding woods.</p>

<p>The modern Torrington consisted of a vast domed
entrance hall with suites of cold lofty rooms to right
and left. To the rear was the old Tudor building
and chapel; here were narrow dark passages, unexpected
steps and low ceilings. It was in this
part of the house that I had previously had my
quarters; it was also in this region that the family
ghost was reported to reside.</p>

<p>On my arrival I was ceremoniously received by
Baker, the butler. Baker had been many years at
Torrington and was a most trustworthy retainer.
There was a legend that <i>he</i> was the butler who, when
master said, “This champagne is corked,” breathed
in his ear, “Never mind, sir, it’ll do for the
ladies!”</p>

<p>Baker, who had grown portly with years, and had
known me as a child, was rather inclined to be paternal
in his manner. He had witnessed my fits of fury
and been privy to my terms of punishment and
disgrace. After a word or two of greeting, he added:</p>

<p>“We have put you in the pink room, Miss Eva.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Baker, I am beyond the nursery now, am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
I not?” I said as I stood beside him in the hall and
looked over his head, now bald and shiny.</p>

<p>“That’s true, miss, a grown-up young lady. I
should say you’d shot up a couple of inches since
you were here last. Tea is laid in the library. I
expect the squire will be in directly.”</p>

<p>A pause of horror as he noticed Kip.</p>

<p>“I say, Miss Eva, this will never do; what about
the dog?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the dog will be all right,” I replied in my
most offhand style, “and no trouble to anyone.”</p>

<p>Baker gave a dubious cough and said:</p>

<p>“You know Mrs. Lingard don’t allow visiting
dogs. I can’t see how we shall manage.”</p>

<p>I made no reply, but turned to ascend to my
room. Baker accompanied me, still muttering to
himself and shaking his head. More than once
he had carried me, kicking and screaming, up these
very stairs! On the first landing I was met and
taken charge of by a smart maid, who ushered me
into one of the second best rooms&mdash;a pretty apartment,
facing south&mdash;and asked me for my keys. I
endeavoured diplomatically and with some success
to interest her with respect to Kip, released my
best hat from durance vile, bathed my face, got into
a new blouse, and hurried down to meet my uncle
in the library. He had just returned from hunting
and brought with him a bracing whiff of keen fresh
air and new leather.</p>

<p>For a moment he stared at me, as if I were an utter
stranger, then exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p>“Hallo, Evie! I scarcely knew you! Glad to
see you!” kissing me on the cheek. “It’s ages since
you were here. How is that, eh?”</p>

<p>Impossible to tell him the bare naked truth, so
I replied, “Don’t you remember, the doctors thought
this place too relaxing for me. But now I am perfectly
well.”</p>

<p>“Eh, that’s good news! Now come along and
pour out tea and give me a big cup. Your aunt
and the girls are detained in London with all these
wedding bothers. She sent me Miss Puckle’s letter,
that told all about that blithering old fool her uncle.
Rather a smash up for Miss Puckle and you! Still
it’s an ill wind that blows nobody good, and I am
very glad to have you here. I say, where did that
dog come from?” as Kipper trotted in with the
footman, escort to poached eggs and hot buttered
toast.</p>

<p>“He was Miss Puckle’s property,” I explained,
“and she gave him to me; he really is a very good
fellow.” (Yes, the days of slipper-eating were no
more!)</p>

<p>“I’m afraid your aunt won’t stand him!” said
my uncle, looking unexpectedly grave. “You see
she keeps griffons herself&mdash;she has them with her
now&mdash;and these fox-terriers are the devil for fighting,
and besides that he is bound to disturb the game.
However, I suppose he can stay till she comes back,
and then maybe we shall be able to find him a good
home.”</p>

<p>Uncle was a handsome dapper little man, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
clean-cut features and a remarkably neat figure.
Ronnie resembled him, and uncle reminded me of
Ronnie in some ways. He and I, being <i>tête à tête</i>, got
on famously: we went for long walks about the place,
over the Home farm and round the coverts. Our
tastes agreed; we both liked the country. We visited
the gardens, the stables, and once or twice I rode
to a meet in one of my cousin’s habits&mdash;which was a
decidedly easy fit. After dinner we played piquet
and talked politics; in short, we became great
friends. Uncle imparted to me in confidence that
he was not much in favour of the brilliant match.
Finsbury was a fellow of his own age and something
of a <i>vieux marcheur</i>. I think&mdash;as he smoked an
excellent cigar by the fire in the library&mdash;uncle forgot
that his listener was only a girl, and talked to me
as freely as one man to another. “Finsbury’s lawyer
had been very stiff over the settlements.” I also
gathered that “Bev was terribly wild and extravagant,
but could do no wrong in his mother’s eyes.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, she even jokes at his bills! There is
nothing of the Lingard in him, not like Ronnie, who
is a Lingard to the bone. I sometimes feel as if he
were my own son. I am proud of Ronnie. As for you,
my dear,” and he patted my arm affectionately, “you
must make yourself at home here, now and always.”</p>

<p>“I should like to, uncle, if I may.”</p>

<p>“What is to hinder you?” he inquired.</p>

<p>I knew, but I could not tell him. Possibly he
guessed, for he added:</p>

<p>“You know your aunt is a good sort, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
take her the right way. Having pots of money
in her own hands is a handicap for any woman”&mdash;he
heaved a tell-tale sigh, then pulled himself up and
said, “Now come along, and let us play piquet.”</p>

<p>It was rather startling to find myself temporary
mistress of this great household, to enter rooms I
had never seen, to examine things I had never ventured
to touch, to play on the grand Steinway piano
undisturbed for hours, to give orders, to ring bells,
and to sit at the head of the table in the place sacred
to my masterful relative. Once I ventured to
open the door of her boudoir, and went in on tiptoe,
but I did not remain long; the whole room
seemed to be imbued with the personality of its
mistress.</p>

<p>On hunting days I was alone. Uncle breakfasted,
booted and spurred, fussed off to some distant
meet, and rarely reappeared before five or six o’clock.
I occupied my spare hours in reading, practising,
and writing letters&mdash;seated at Aunt Mina’s bureau
in the morning room, and using the best paper headed
“Torrington Park.” As the family were known to
be from home, there were no visitors except the
rector, and the wife of uncle’s agent, Mrs. Paget-Taylor,
who had made a delightful home for herself
in the old Dower House across the park.</p>

<hr class="tb"  />

<p>It was an ideal hunting day, damp and cloudy.
In the afternoon, Kipper and I, who had been for
a long tramp through the bare wet woods, sat together
on a big buffalo rug before the fire in the library.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
I think I must have been dozing, when I heard the
door open and a sonorous voice announce:</p>

<p>“Captain Falkland.”</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet, and so did Kipper. Captain
Falkland looked astonished as he advanced, then
halted and said:</p>

<p>“The butler told me I would find Miss Lingard
here.”</p>

<p>“Miss Eva Lingard,” I corrected. “My aunt
and cousins are in London. Uncle is out hunting, but
he may be in at any moment.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I doubt that,” said the visitor. “The hounds
met at Grantley, and it is a capital scenting day;
if they find, he will have a long ride home.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?” I said, pointing to a
chair near the fire.</p>

<p>“It’s odd,” he remarked, looking at me as he
seated himself, “but I have never seen you here,
and I have often been over for shoots. My people
are only ten miles away.”</p>

<p>“That is easily explained,” I replied, “most of my
time has been spent at school, and since I left Cheltenham
I  have been living with my old governess at Beke.
At least”&mdash;correcting myself&mdash;“she is not <i>very</i> old,
but she was with my cousins here for a long time.”</p>

<p>“But Beke&mdash;why Beke? What a dismal hole!
I have been there to buy tobacco, and rank bad stuff
it was!”</p>

<p>“They say Beke is healthy, and the doctors
thought Torrington didn’t suit me.”</p>

<p>“But surely you are all right now?” he remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
briskly. “I’ve come over to say good-bye, as I’m
off to India on Friday. I am sorry to miss the
squire, but, on the other hand, am awfully glad
to find <i>you</i> here. You have been such a most
distracting puzzle to me.”</p>

<p>“A puzzle,” I echoed, as I rang for tea and
lights. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Why did you go to that beanfeast at Mirfield?
You must allow that it was surprising to see a girl of
your class among that crowd.”</p>

<p>“I went to that dance just to break the deadly
monotony of Beke. I worried Lizzie&mdash;that is to
say, Miss Puckle&mdash;I made her life such a burden
that she gave me leave to go for once. It was to
be a dead secret, and I never dreamt that anyone I
met there would ever see me again.”</p>

<p>“I say, what a crew!” he exclaimed, “That
fellow with the red tie and yellow boots, and the
one in the white sweater!”</p>

<p>“Yes, they were unconventional, I admit, but
good kind souls, and I was not in the least ashamed
of being in their society. I enjoyed myself immensely&mdash;my
first ball!”</p>

<p>“Your first ball!” he repeated scornfully. “Well,
you had a festive time going home in that shandrydan,
I should say!”</p>

<p>As I did not wish to pursue the subject, I asked:</p>

<p>“Do you take sugar?”</p>

<p>“If you please; and so I see you have brought
your dog?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but only for a short stay. Dogs are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
admitted here. I must find him a home somewhere.
They won’t have him at the rectory, and the gamekeeper
says no, too&mdash;though he admires Kip.”</p>

<p>“So Mrs. Lingard bars dogs?”</p>

<p>“All but her own griffons. And you are starting
for India on Friday? How I envy you! I
wonder if you will be anywhere near my brother?”</p>

<p>“I am going to Secunderabad in the Deccan.”</p>

<p>“How extraordinary! That is where Ronnie
is quartered.”</p>

<p>“Then he is in the Service?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the ‘Lighthearts,’ and has just got his
company. He came to see me last September, when
he was home on leave. He was not favourably
impressed by Beke, and suggested my going to India
as a paying guest with nice people. There are only
the two of us, and at least we should be in the same
country. He wrote to Uncle Horace on the subject,
but nothing happened.”</p>

<p>“The squire is your uncle?”</p>

<p>“Yes; my father was his only brother.”</p>

<p>Captain Falkland stared into his teacup, as if
he saw something there of engrossing interest, then
raising his eyes to mine, he said:</p>

<p>“I see; and so you have been released from Beke,
and have come to live here? Are the Lingards your
nearest relations?”</p>

<p>“My only ones, except Ronnie&mdash;and he is much
more than a mere relation.” I cannot imagine
what folly possessed me, but I added, “He is very
popular here&mdash;but I am not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p>“Impossible!” exclaimed my companion with
ready politeness, “How could that be?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a long story&mdash;much too long.”</p>

<p>“Do tell it to me,” he urged, “I shall wait for
your uncle; there’s nothing to do but talk this
gloomy afternoon, and as you are deputy hostess, I
expect to be entertained!”</p>

<p>“But it’s merely a family prejudice,” I objected,
“and not the least amusing.”</p>

<p>“Your family and mine are old friends and even
connections, so why not share the little ‘jars’ with me?”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case you shall hear all there is to
tell,” I replied. (Alas! it never required much
persuasion to encourage me to talk.) “Ronnie
and I arrived here as orphans, when he was ten
and I was four. Aunt Mina took to him at once,
he has such a dear open face and charming manners;
but I&mdash;well, we had come from France&mdash;and I
missed my <i>bonne</i>. I loathed porridge and lots of
things. I had been spoiled. I gave way to furies,
and there is a legend that in one of my rages I bit
a piece out of a saucer! In fact, I was always in
disgrace, so I was sent to school at Cheltenham,
where Ronnie was at college, and we saw one
another every week. Then in the holidays I generally
brought back something&mdash;measles, chicken pox or
mumps&mdash;so you won’t be surprised to hear that I
was left at school altogether, and only for missing
Ronnie, I much preferred it.”</p>

<p>“The family black lamb!” he ejaculated with a
laugh, then added, “Is that all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, my past career has been tame&mdash;and my
future is uncertain.”</p>

<p>“It lies in the lap of the gods?” suggested Captain
Falkland.</p>

<p>“No indeed, but in the hands of Aunt Wilhelmina.
Uncle and I get on together splendidly, but I don’t
know how it will be when she returns. You see my
aunt has not seen me for two years, and she, I am
afraid, can only think of me as a detestable, ill-tempered,
sickly child. My fate, like that of Kipper,
is trembling in the balance.”</p>

<p>“Kipper’s fate need no longer tremble,” declared
Captain Falkland. “With your permission,
I will undertake his future.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you are going to India?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I shall be rather glad of a dog. They
are great company, and these fox-terriers are the
only breed that really thrive in a hot place, and I
believe Secunderabad is fairly warm.”</p>

<p>“If you will really take Kipper,” I said, “I
shall be most grateful, and he will see an old friend
out there&mdash;my brother. If Kip is tiresome, you must
pass him on.”</p>

<p>“I have never met your brother, as I am only
recently appointed as A.D.C. to the general, but I
shall look him up, and carry him any messages or
parcels from you.”</p>

<p>“Tell him not to be so lazy about writing, and
that you found me happily established here.”</p>

<p>“But still, so to speak, ‘on approval?’”</p>

<p>“I suppose it amounts to that!” Then suddenly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
overwhelmed with qualms at my indiscreet outpourings,
I added, “But please, Captain Falkland,
forget <i>everything</i> I have told you. You know you
made me talk, and I am afraid I am only too
ready to chatter, and let my tongue run away
with me.”</p>

<p>“There I envy you, for I can’t talk, or ever get
out half I want to say. When I was a boy I had
a hesitation in my speech; it was cured, but the
memory has always tied my tongue. My family
call me ‘Dummy.’ I suppose Miss Puckle kept
you in great order?”</p>

<p>“No indeed, she merely pointed out my faults.”</p>

<p>“And these are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Having told you so much I may as well confess
that I like to talk when I get the chance. Since
leaving school I have led rather a solitary sort of
life. Miss Puckle was busy all day in the parish,
or flying over the country on her bike. At night
she was generally dead tired, and would lie on the
sofa while I played to her, and the professor was buried
in his books. Here, my uncle has been away since
eight o’clock this morning, and I have had no one
to speak to except Baker the butler, and of course
we cannot advance beyond the weather, so when I
get hold of listeners, I don’t spare them!”</p>

<p>“But your faults?” he persisted.</p>

<p>“Talking too much&mdash;being unguarded and
impulsive, proud, and they say, hot-tempered!
Turn about is fair play. What about your weaknesses?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p>“Silence is best,” he answered with a laugh.</p>

<p>“And I have confessed everything! Just like me.
Well, even so, it might have been worse. As you are
going to India we are not likely to meet again, and
you will soon forget my chatter and myself.”</p>

<p>“I have a tenacious memory, Miss Lingard. In
fact, I may say, that I am tenacious about most
things and I shall not forget you. You never expected
to come across me after that night of the dance,
when you were so mysterious, and, may I add&mdash;so
saucy? Yet here I am, and actually in possession
of your dog. I shall keep you posted up in his
career. I may write to you, may I not?”</p>

<p>“Write,” I ejaculated, my breath taken completely
away, “I should like to hear&mdash;&mdash;” then I hesitated.
“Of course I know that lots of girls write to
men&mdash;my cousins do&mdash;but I’ve never corresponded
with anyone but Ronnie; my aunt would ask
questions, and wonder how I made your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“You made my acquaintance at Torrington.
Our official acquaintance only began to-day. I
shall certainly drop you a line.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no, please do not write,” I protested
with energy. Then, aware of the presence of a soft-footed
manservant, who had entered to remove the
tea things, I broke off abruptly and hastily changed
the conversation. I believe Charles was deeply
interested in our talk, for he lingered over his task,
and rearranged the saucers on the tray with very
deliberate exactitude. Just after he left the room a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
little tinkling clock chimed six and my companion
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“I say,” he exclaimed, “it is later than I thought!
Awfully sorry I can’t wait to see the squire; give him
all sorts of messages for me. Well,” stooping, “come
along, Kip, say good-bye to your missis,” suddenly
raising the drowsy and astonished animal and holding
him towards me.</p>

<p>“Must he go now, so soon?” I faltered.</p>

<p>Captain Falkland nodded, and as I kissed Kipper
between his eyes I felt a great lump in my throat.
I was parting with one of my very few friends, but
I instinctively realised that I had bestowed him on
a kind master.</p>

<p>With the struggling dog hoisted under his arm,
his new owner wrung my hand, and said,</p>

<p>“Good-bye, I promise to take jolly good care of
Kip.” He paused as if about to add something, then
evidently changed his mind, hastily opened the door,
and went forth. For my part, I resisted an almost
overpowering impulse to follow him into the hall, but
I was aware that such a proceeding would be outrageously
improper. What would Baker think and
say? As I stood half-hearted and uncertain in the
middle of the room, I heard a motor buzzing down
the avenue. He was gone! Then I went and sat on the
rug before the fire, now entirely alone, and was aware
of a curious sense of personal desolation. I dared
not trust my heart to answer the question, which
of the two I most regretted&mdash;the man or the dog?</p>

<p>By and by uncle arrived in exuberant spirits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
talking himself into the library at the top of his clear,
well-bred voice. It had been as Captain Falkland
predicted, “the run of the season.” I was not a
sportswoman, and I listened with politely assumed
interest to a vivid description of the desperate going
over Hippersly, the amount of grief that ensued,
and the astonishing exploits of two hunters. At
last, after having blown off sufficient steam, he said:</p>

<p>“So I’m told Falkland has been here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he came to say good-bye to you. He
starts for India on Friday. He waited ages.”</p>

<p>“What do you call ages?”</p>

<p>“Over an hour.”</p>

<p>After a pause of astonishment:</p>

<p>“You must have made yourself mighty agreeable,
eh? Falkland hasn’t much to say for himself. He
is a rattling good sort and a keen soldier, but not a
ladies’ man.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, he made himself very agreeable
to <i>me</i>, for he has taken Kipper off my hands.”</p>

<p>“What, the dog! Well, well, that’s all right!
He would be a bit of a nuisance when your aunt came
home. I hope he won’t get into trouble with Lady
Louisa’s prize cats.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is no fear of that,” I answered eagerly,
“for Captain Falkland is taking Kip with him to
India.”</p>

<p>Uncle stared at me, and gave a loud whistle.</p>

<p>“I say, Eva, keep that dark! If your aunt were
to hear of this dog-giving, and taking, she’d&mdash;anyway,
there’d be wigs on the green!”</p>

<span>THE FAMILY SKELETON</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Paget-Taylor</span>, whose society had been so
urgently recommended by my aunt, was the wife
of uncle’s agent, Captain Paget-Taylor, a broad-shouldered,
long-headed, active man of fifty, a
first-rate farmer and a celebrated shot. His consort
was a little dark woman endowed with extraordinary
animation, tact and capability. Her house
was comfortable and well appointed, her cook a
treasure, her delightful drawing-room furnished with
most inviting sofas and chairs, delicious cushions,
stacks of flowers, and softly shaded lamps. This
apartment was the council chamber and scene of
many important conferences, for Mrs. Paget-Taylor
was a power in the neighbourhood. From her kidney-shaped
writing table she pulled many strings and
was credited with an ample supply of what is known
as “interest.” Her activities, although of the same
genre, were on a different scale to those of Lizzie
Puckle. Whilst Lizzie harangued school children,
took the chair at meetings, got up rummage sales,
and shepherded outlying hamlets, Mrs. Paget-Taylor
merely held interviews and confidential conversations.
She was known to be exceedingly insidious and persuasive,
and I may say at once that she was my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
aunt’s right hand! My relative referred to Mrs. Paget-Taylor
on every question and in every crisis&mdash;whether
it was the matter of a new kitchen range or a prospective
son-in-law; and, as the agent’s wife had no
family and ample leisure, she was in a position to
throw herself heart and soul into other people’s
affairs.</p>

<p>No one in the whole neighbourhood was so
popular as Mrs. Paget-Taylor; she was always agreeable,
well dressed, helpful, and sympathetic. Half the
girls and the young married women laid their
miseries before her, and she might almost be said
to have kept a high-class registry office for marriages
and situations!</p>

<p>When I arrived at Torrington the lady happened
to be away from home. A week later I received
a note from the Dower House, inviting me down
to tea. Naturally I accepted with pleasure, although
I impressed upon myself as I walked across the park
that I must be very cautious and not give myself
away, or burst into impulsive confidences, as had
been the case in my last <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paget-Taylor invited me partly from
good nature, and partly in order to hold an inspection,
on which to report on me elsewhere. As I
entered, the atmosphere of the place seemed to
exude warmth and comfort; the flagged entrance
hall was covered with a thick carpet, heated by a
great log fire, and furnished with old oak chests
and chairs. Somehow I liked the feel of the
place!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span></p>

<p>I found the mistress of the house in the drawing-room,
hastily stamping letters for the evening post.
As she rose and offered me an affectionate embrace,
her keen dark eyes swept me with one swift glance
and she said:</p>

<p>“So glad to see you, Eva! I am sorry I have been
away until to-day. You must have found it terribly
dull, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” I answered mendaciously. “Uncle is
very kind, and takes me about with him. He lends
me ‘Old Soldier,’ and on the days he doesn’t hunt
we go for long rides.”</p>

<p>“You are grown up now,” she said, drawing me
towards the sofa, “and not a Lingard, like your
brother! You look such a vivid, youthful, happy
creature, you must be a Mostyn. I remember
hearing that your mother had masses of wonderful
hair and such smiling grey eyes.”</p>

<p>“Are my eyes smiling?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she assented. “I noticed them when you
were here two years ago&mdash;sunny eyes, I would call
them. Now come and let us have a nice talk and
tell me all about yourself.”</p>

<p>“There’s so little to tell. If you knew Beke,
you would understand.”</p>

<p>“You are quite strong, I can see&mdash;the picture of
health. I am sure you are glad of the change and
looking for a little excitement, and things to happen,
are you not?”</p>

<p>After we had talked about the family and the
forthcoming marriage, my aunt’s bronchitis and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
professor’s enormities, there was a slight pause, and
I was surprised to hear myself saying:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Paget-Taylor, you know everybody and
everything. I should be so grateful if you would
tell me a little about my parents. Whenever I ask
my aunt her answers are vague. I have my mother’s
picture, and I know she died in France, and that my
father was so broken-hearted that he threw up his
commission and disappeared to America, where he
died.”</p>

<p>“I never saw your mother,” said Mrs. Paget-Taylor,
now looking at the fire with an immovable
face. “She was seldom in England. Your father’s
regiment was quartered in the Mediterranean, but
I have always heard that she was most attractive,
well born, and an orphan. Your father met her on
board ship, coming home from Egypt. She had a
moderate fortune&mdash;which luckily was settled on the
children.”</p>

<p>“But why do you say luckily?” I inquired
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Because, my dear girl, your father was hopeless
in that respect. He had no conscience where
money was concerned. He was a confirmed gambler.
I am sorry to say it is in the Lingard blood&mdash;and
just let me give you one little friendly hint:
do not ask questions or talk about him at the
Park?”</p>

<p>“But why not?” I asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paget-Taylor made no reply, but again turned
away her face and stared steadily at the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p>“He is dead, is he not?” I persisted.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered slowly, “dead, this many
years, but I would rather not say any more except
this: he is the family skeleton in the cupboard&mdash;best
leave him there.”</p>

<p>For a moment, indeed for much longer, I sat
beside my hostess in stunned silence, then with a
great effort I began to put on my gloves, and prepared
to take my departure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paget-Taylor noticed my emotion, and instantly
became motherly and sympathetic.</p>

<p>“I know exactly how you feel, my dear,” putting
her hand on my shoulder, and looking into my face,
“completely unhinged, of course; what I have told
you must be a most painful shock, but it was better&mdash;yes,
and kinder&mdash;to put you on your guard. It
is all such an old story now; thank goodness, most
people have short memories. It is said that nothing
which is in the blood dies. The Torringtons have
always been afraid that the family curse might
reappear in you or Ronnie&mdash;especially Ronnie,
but he is as steady as Old Time&mdash;such a relief!
My dear, whenever you feel inclined, I shall be
too glad if you will come down to see me, and I
do hope you will find yourself <i>very</i> happy at the
Park.”</p>

<p>Here, as the door opened to admit some belated
visitors, I effected my escape.</p>

<p>All the way home in the dark, although I might
still be “youthful and vivid,” I was no longer a
“happy” creature; my mind was tormented with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
the problem of my parents’ story, and it exercised my
thoughts for many a day.</p>

<p>I struggled to recall what I could from misty
memories of long ago. There was an impression of
a great deal of bright sunshine, of being carried up
long streets with steps, of a tall lady in white, and
a dark man with gold buttons on his coat&mdash;and that
was all!</p>

<span>“AN OPEN DOOR”</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days after my visit to the Dower House, Aunt
Mina arrived home. Her return occasioned an
extraordinary commotion; what conscientious dusting,
what airing of rooms, and what extravagant fires!
She was accompanied by my cousins, her future
son-in-law, and various guests, also by several maids&mdash;including
her kennel-maid and four tiny griffons.
We had not met for nearly two years, and the deadly
fear I entertained of her in childhood and flapperdom
had waned. My nerves were stronger, I felt more
independent, I looked on my aunt dispassionately,
fought hard to smother my sense of personal antipathy
and distaste, and to put myself in the place of
a stranger, meeting her for the first time. If my
uncle was well featured, and of short stature, his wife
was his opposite in appearance; tall and bony, with
high square shoulders, a pair of bluish green eyes,
a large domineering nose, and a sunken, bitter mouth.
A plain woman, who made the utmost of her appearance,
had admirable taste in dress, and carried herself
with dignity. I am glad to state that I did not
quail when we met in the library, and she accorded
me a smudgy kiss.</p>

<p>“Delighted to see you, Eva,” she said. “Hubert,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
turning to an elderly gentleman with an eyeglass,
“this is my niece, or rather my husband’s niece, Eva
Lingard.”</p>

<p>Sir Beaufort Finsbury bowed, carefully rearranged
his eyeglass, and, on second thoughts, offered me his
hand.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Eva!” exclaimed Clara, “Here you are!
And so you’ve been hobnobbing with the pater all
this time? You look as if you’d grown a foot, but,
my dear girl, how abominably you do your hair!”</p>

<p>“She’s got stacks of it, anyhow,” put in her
sister; “no pads, nothing put on, eh, Eva?”
Dora had always befriended me.</p>

<p>Clara was my senior by seven or eight years.
When I was a small child in the nursery she had
been a well-grown girl in the schoolroom, and a cruel
and merciless bully. She was tall, with a stoop, and
had pale reddish hair, a thick white skin, and heavy
white eyelids, half concealing her pale prominent
eyes. As Clara had a sharp, merciless tongue, wore
glasses and subscribed to the London Library, she
was generally spoken of as “the clever Miss Lingard.”
Dora, on the other hand, was dull and indolent, but
good looking, in a lazy dark style, and much more
amiable than her sister. She was fond of bridge,
and did a little betting on the sly! Was the hereditary
failing to reappear in <i>her</i>?</p>

<p>The party from London, a gay one, was chiefly
composed of Sir Beaufort’s friends and some of the
Lingard connections who had “handles” to their
names. One day we patronised a point-to-point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
steeplechase, the next a race meeting; at night,
there was bridge and dancing. My aunt had brought
me some evening dresses, my hair was arranged in
the latest fashion, and I no longer looked like Beke&mdash;nor
felt like it either! I enjoyed myself vastly,
and was privately informed by Dora that her mother
was pleased with me, and that I had been quite
presentable. I really believe that at this time my
aunt almost liked me. I was ready to help her by
writing menus and notes, giving a last little touch to
the table decorations, and “taking on” the bores.
Moreover, I was in considerable demand as a partner
for bridge and dancing, and possibly my chaperon
had agreeable visions of getting me speedily off her
hands.</p>

<p>Early in April the wedding took place, after a
week of the most strenuous preparations. The house
was packed to the very roof, and I confess that I was
not sorry when the whole affair was over, the bride
had said farewell, the last handful of rice had been
thrown, and the departing motor become a mere
speck on the avenue.</p>

<p>Bev, who had come down expressly for the day,
renewed his attentions to me. He informed me that
he found me enormously improved in appearance.
Unfortunately, I was not able to repay the compliment
in kind. Bev had none of the good looks of
the Lingard family. To me he always bore a
ridiculous resemblance to a young gander. A very
long thin neck, a very long beaky nose, a small flat
head and no chin, supported this impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span></p>

<p>We had settled into the usual routine, and my
aunt was beginning to talk of a couple of weeks in
London and a June Drawing Room, when, to the
consternation of the whole family, Beverley reappeared,
having been sent down from Oxford.
Apparently his scrapes had reached a climax. There
were debts, too! Uncle’s face looked grim and glum,
and even my aunt, always so indulgent, was obviously
displeased with her darling.</p>

<p>Suppressed by his parents and sister, Bev turned
for consolation to me. He followed me about like a
shadow and was absolutely impervious to snubs.
If I went out riding he became my escort; if I escaped
for a walk, or into the old schoolroom, he tracked me
down and joined me. My angry protests were of no
avail, and I could not help feeling that my aunt was
really unlucky. Here was an idle ne’er-do-well
loafing about at home. Here was also the niece,
whose attractions she feared&mdash;and the pair were continually
together!</p>

<p>For my part I sought refuge with Clara or Mrs.
Paget-Taylor, but what was to be done upon wet
days? On one of these Bev joined me in the old
schoolroom, where I had ensconced myself before a
good fire with a new novel in my hand. I gave
him a very tepid reception, as he drew up a chair,
put his long feet on the chimneypiece, and lit a
cigarette.</p>

<p>“I have been hunting for you everywhere,” he
announced.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “like the little boy in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
fable, who wanted somebody to play with; but I’m
not going to play,” I added sharply, “and if you
worry I shall go and sit up in my own room.” And I
returned to my book.</p>

<p>“By Jove, Eva, you are changed!” he exclaimed,
“such a grand, stand-off young lady. Do you
remember how in this very room we used to roast
chestnuts and make horrible toffee? We were great
pals then, why can’t we be pals now?”</p>

<p>“Everything is different,” I replied without
raising my eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh yes; instead of being a long-legged flapper,
with red hands and a cold in your head, you have
bloomed into a great beauty.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense,” I said impatiently.</p>

<p>“By Jove, it’s true! Old Finny”&mdash;thus did he
refer to the baronet, his brother-in-law&mdash;“said that
if you were brought out in London you would make
a tremendous stir.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish,” I ejaculated, “he was pulling your
leg.”</p>

<p>“Not mine; he was talking to the governor; and
young Chambers told me there was no one to touch
you at the Belmont hop, that the men were falling
over one another to get a dance, and I don’t wonder.”
Here he brought down his legs with a crash, threw
his cigarette into the fire, and, turning to face me,
said, “Eva, I adore you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” I answered rudely.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice way to talk to a fellow,” he exclaimed
in an injured tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<p>“It’s the right way when a fellow is talking
nonsense.”</p>

<p>“You would be the making of me, Evie; you
know that,” he continued, towering over me as he
spoke; “you are awfully clever, the governor says&mdash;so
clear-headed and sensible, with a capital seat
on horseback, and uncommon good looks. He is dead
nuts on you. Come now, say you will marry me!”</p>

<p>“And what about your mother?” I asked.</p>

<p>For a moment he was dumb.</p>

<p>“Well, if she objects and makes the place too
hot to hold any of us, I’ll marry a chorus girl. After
all, I’m one and twenty and the property is strictly
entailed.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be cutting a rod to beat yourself, my
good Bev, and I should be truly sorry for the poor
chorus girl, and incidentally for you. I like you all
right, Bev, as a cousin. I do not forget that you
always took my part and befriended me when I was
in disgrace&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, now the boot is on the other foot,” he
interrupted, “I’m in everybody’s black books, I’m
in disgrace with the pater, so won’t you befriend
me? Turn about is fair play.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Bev, that the only thing I can offer
you is advice. Why don’t you try for a commission
in the army?”</p>

<p>“Too old.”</p>

<p>“Well then, travel; go and see the world.”</p>

<p>“If you will come along with me I’ll go like a
shot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p>Ignoring this suggestion with a wave of my
hand, I continued my admonition&mdash;</p>

<p>“You really must give up betting and cards&mdash;&mdash;”
History, as we all know, repeats itself; even as I
spoke the door opened, and my aunt entered.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;&mdash;” and she paused expressively. That
“Oh” was dramatic; it conveyed volumes of disapproval.</p>

<p>“Eva, I have been looking for you everywhere.
I want you to collect the books for Mudie’s, make
out a fresh list, and, as the maid is ill, will you wash
two of the griffons?”</p>

<p>She spoke in her normal voice, but her jaw was
set and her suspicious blue-green eyes roved backwards
and forwards from Beverley to me.</p>

<p>“All right,” I said, rising with alacrity, only too
thankful to close the interview; and as I followed
Aunt Mina down the long flagged passages, I knew
from the expression of her back, as surely as if she
had told me in words, that her fears respecting
Bev and myself were once more awakened.</p>

<p>My life at this period was by no means a bed of
roses. Uncle was laid up with a sharp attack of
gout, possibly brought on by the shock of Beverley’s
debts. Beverley persecuted me. He was quite too
dreadfully cunning, a domestic Sherlock Holmes, and
seemed, in spite of his mother’s most anxious
precautions, to mark down my exact whereabouts
with unfailing accuracy. I snubbed him mercilessly,
even at meal-times, and, strange to say, my brusque
little speeches aroused Aunt Mina’s ire; yet if I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
been agreeable she would have been furious and
have declared that I was “drawing him on.” There
was no pleasing her, but, poor woman, the situation
was harassing; she could not send Beverley from
home, as he was not to be trusted&mdash;her only alternative
was to make some desperate effort to get rid
of <i>me</i>! Alas! this was a hopeless undertaking.
Consequently, so far as I was concerned, she
became the very incarnation of despotism and
aggression.</p>

<p>Although I lived in a luxurious abode, shared a
maid with my cousin Clara (my share I may mention
was merely nominal), had a delightful horse to ride,
a superb piano to play on, quantities of books and
most dainty food, I was far from being happy or
contented. The truth was that the continual strain of
holding Beverley at bay on the one hand, and vainly
attempting to soothe his mother’s fears on the other,
was altogether too much for my nervous system. The
tension was terrible, a tension that was never relaxed.
Just at this particular crisis our good genius, Mrs.
Paget-Taylor, came to the assistance of the family.
She constantly entertained visitors in her comfortable
Dower House; sometimes these were relations,
sometimes old friends, and occasionally there
were casual acquaintances whom she had picked
up abroad or when doing a “cure” at home.</p>

<p>One afternoon she appeared, just before tea-time,
accompanied by two guests, a lady and gentleman;
the former, who followed her closely across the slippery
parquet floor of the vast drawing-room, was entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
uncommon and picturesquely different from our
everyday callers. The visitor who approached in
the wake of Mrs. Paget-Taylor held herself erect,
her head slightly thrown back; her face was strikingly
handsome, she had wavy brown hair, straight black
brows, extraordinarily expressive eyes, and a brilliant
complexion. These details can give but a faint idea
of her personality. She wore a costume of some
rich dark blue material with little touches of gold,
and a hat that was equally <i>chic</i> and becoming. The
vision was so vivid and impressive that I could do
nothing but gaze, and gaze, and gaze.</p>

<p>The strangers were presented as “Captain and Mrs.
Hayes-Billington,” and Mrs. Paget-Taylor murmured
to my aunt that he was “a far away connection,
at present on leave from India.” Captain Hayes-Billington
was a stout well-set-up man of thirty, with
regular features and a heavy dark moustache, but his
face had a puffy appearance; indeed, he was altogether
puffy, and to me his arms and legs recalled
inflated air cushions, so tightly did his grey suit
encase them. He was not in the least overawed
or dumbfounded, as were some, by the magnificence
of Torrington, but chatted away to Aunt Mina about
“my regiment,” “my appointment,” and “my
mines,” and carried round the tea-cups with the
address of long practice. Mrs. Hayes-Billington also
took part in the general conversation. She had a
sweet, rather low voice, and exhibited when she spoke
glimpses of beautiful teeth. Her manners were easy
and assured, and her smile was radiant. Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
smiles thawed Aunt Mina’s usual manner of ice and
iron. She was always amenable when she realised
that people were not afraid of her. This stranger
was fearless, and listened to her account of the super-griffon’s
asthma with an admirably assumed air
of absorption and sympathy. It was wonderful
how rapidly she stole into my aunt’s good graces.
They discussed Monte Carlo, and the rapacity of
milliners, and compared their experiences of French
hotels. The visitor also exchanged a few sentences
with Bev, who, instead of fleeing from callers as
usual, was sitting, tea-cup in hand, staring at Mrs.
Hayes-Billington with wide open pea-green eyes.</p>

<p>She inquired the name of his regiment, which
query, strange to say, delicately flattered his greedy
vanity.</p>

<p>“Not in the army?” she repeated incredulously,
“I certainly thought you were in the Guards.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he rejoined, “I am going into the
Diplomatic Service”; which was the first that anyone
had heard of it!</p>

<p>It transpired that the couple were spending a
whole week at the Dower House ere returning to
India in a month’s time, and presently I screwed
up my courage and ventured to ask her how she
liked the East.</p>

<p>“Oh it’s all right, as long as one is young,” she
answered in a deep, rather vibrant voice, looking
at me steadily with her marvellous dark eyes. “We
have always been in the Punjaub, but this time we
are bound for the Deccan. Herbert has been given a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
very good appointment there. It will be an entirely
new country.”</p>

<p>Before the little party took leave, my aunt, much
to my astonishment, invited them to dinner, for as
a rule she never extended hospitality to the Dower
House guests.</p>

<p>No sooner had they left us than a chorus of
remarks arose, all in praise of Mrs. Hayes-Billington.
Bev was particularly loud and eloquent. His mother
and sister agreed that she was handsome, smart,
and not in the least the usual type of officer’s wife
that drifted home from India, washed out, flabby
and dowdy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hayes-Billington’s appearance of an evening
was positively dazzling; in fact, I may say that the
effect of her beauty on a country cousin like myself
was almost overwhelming. She wore a rose-coloured
gown, very <i>décolletée</i>, a diamond bandeau
in her dark wavy hair, and was undoubtedly the
queen of the company. What was Aunt Mina in
dark green velvet? What was I, in my new white
<i>crêpe de Chine</i>? Merely the background of an exquisite
picture.</p>

<p>We were a party of twelve; four from the Dower
House, five of ourselves, the rector and his wife
(she was a bishop’s daughter) and young Tom Champneys,
a neighbour. Uncle took in Mrs. Hayes-Billington,
who sat between him and Bev. I came
next to Bev, with Captain Paget-Taylor on my left
hand. At the head of the table Aunt Mina was
supported by Captain Hayes-Billington and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
rector. Mrs. Hayes-Billington talked away with
great animation to my uncle. She discoursed of pig-sticking,
jackal hunting, and racing, and asked many
questions about our local pack; but somehow I
received an impression that she and my uncle did
not hit it off. It struck me that my usually voluble
relation was somewhat reserved in his manner,
though always the polite and attentive host. Occasionally
she addressed herself to Bev, and found
him eagerly responsive.</p>

<p>From the other end of the table I could hear
Captain Hayes-Billington relating experiences and
stories to Aunt Mina and the rector in a loud, jovial
voice. I caught one or two stories&mdash;chestnuts, no
doubt&mdash;with regard to a certain class called “Baboos.”
One of them had announced that “the army was a
glorious profession in time of peace, but in time of
war highly dangerous.” Another, who had given
his seat to a lady, on her saying she was sorry to
deprive him of it, replied, “No depravity, madam!”
The raconteur laughed so uproariously at his own
anecdotes that his hearers were compelled to join&mdash;even
my aunt accorded a fixed smile.</p>

<p>Young Champneys, who sat opposite, suddenly
addressed Captain Paget-Taylor across the table, and
said:</p>

<p>“Last time I was in town I saw Falkland at the
club. He was just starting for India. He seemed
a bit bothered by a dog he had with him. He told
me it had been given to him by a girl.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rats!” exclaimed Bev, “Falkland isn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
a ladies’ man, we all know that. He bought the
brute at Whiteley’s.”</p>

<p>“Funny sort of aide-de-camp he’ll make,” said
Captain Paget-Taylor; “I can’t see him escorting
women, writing invitations, and doing the carpet
knight! Falkland is a keen soldier, his character
is as strong as a breakwater, but his manner is
short and he has no parlour tricks! I believe the
general is a connection of Lady Louisa’s, and as
Falkland had a pretty stiff time in the Soudan, and
as a lad got knocked about in the Boer War, his
mother clamoured for this easy billet, but of course
<i>he</i> knows nothing about that!”</p>

<p>Once in the drawing-room, Mrs. Hayes-Billington
and my aunt paired off together and enthroned themselves
on a sofa, whilst I was dispatched to the
piano and commanded to play and sing. Mrs.
Paget-Taylor and the rector’s wife discussed the
temper of the parish nurse, and Clara wrote letters.</p>

<p>Between my unappreciated songs I noticed that
Aunt Mina and her guest were engaged in what
appeared to be an absorbing conversation. Mrs.
Hayes-Billington undertook most of the talking, and
was evidently explaining something to my relative,
to which she listened with unusual attention, punctuating
the information from time to time with slow,
impressive nods.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Paget-Taylor came up to
Torrington, and had a long private conference with
my aunt in her boudoir. Subsequently the Hayes-Billingtons
were invited to lunch and the lady was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
taken for a drive in the family landau&mdash;a most unusual
favour&mdash;and, so far as I could divine, for no ostensible
reason. It soon became evident that <i>I</i> was the
cause of all this hospitality and condescension. To
make a long story short, the Hayes-Billingtons were
hard up; a year at home had proved unexpectedly
costly, and they would gladly undertake the charge
of a nice girl, if it were made worth while. Their terms
were £150 a year inclusive, to be paid quarterly.
All this my cousin Clara imparted to me with considerable
zest, for although she and I had never
openly quarrelled we were far from being really
congenial, and apparently she now saw a happy
opportunity for displacing me. In her opinion one
Miss Lingard in the landau, or the new car, was
amply sufficient, and, with a heavily charged brush,
she painted my future prospects in glowing colours,
finishing off the picture with the announcement:</p>

<p>“You will have a splendid time out there, Eva,
you are so lively and superficial, and such a good
dancer&mdash;just the right sort of girl to go to India.”</p>

<p>This may have been a left-handed compliment,
but when, as Lord Chesterfield said, a compliment
is doubtful, it is best to accept it. My cousin candidly
admitted that my uncle was inflexibly opposed
to Mrs. Paget-Taylor’s scheme. He thought Captain
Hayes-Billington a loud bragging sort of
bounder; as for his wife, she was a handsome woman,
there could be no two opinions about that, but somehow
or other she was not his style. She wore too
much scent, made too much use of her eyes, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
couldn’t exactly place her; but then he was always
particularly fastidious. “To come down to the bedrock
of the whole question,” said Clara, in conclusion,
“what do you think yourself, Eva?”</p>

<p>I was not prepared to give her an answer on the
spot, and felt rather inclined to fall in with my uncle’s
opinion. Captain Hayes-Billington, though good-natured,
was loud and slangy, and in spite of her
spell there was something odd about his wife. She
glowed with beauty like some hard irresponsive gem,
and for all her flow of impulsive talk I instinctively
felt that she was really as cold as a well-cut diamond.
I paced slowly up and down the room with my hands
locked behind my back, then I went and stood for
some time looking out of the window, endeavouring
to concentrate my mind on the “fors” and
“againsts.” Suddenly below in the Italian garden
I beheld Beverley, who, having caught sight of me,
halted and signalled violently with his handkerchief.
No doubt my aunt was watching him from her
boudoir&mdash;which was just below&mdash;and believed that
I was encouraging this frantic demonstration.</p>

<p>Oh, I felt my present position to be absolutely
intolerable. Yes, even if I went out of the frying-pan
into the fire, I resolved to accompany the Hayes-Billingtons
to India!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_9">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span>OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">What</span> a change in my life a few hours had brought. I
was going to India! My dream of dreams was about to
be fulfilled. In the meanwhile there were arrangements
and obstacles to be talked over. Uncle, Beverley
and Lizzie Puckle were strongly opposed to my trip,
but for once Aunt Mina and I were agreed, and to
every objection we presented an invincible force
of obstinate resistance. She gave me enthusiastic
support, was my firm and eager ally, generously
engaged to pay for my outfit and passage, and
assured me that I should have a delightful time
and that this accidental invitation was “a great
chance!” She even went so far as to hint that I
would not be long with the Hayes-Billingtons, but
soon comfortably installed in an establishment of
my own.</p>

<p>“Really, my dear Eva,” she said in an outburst
of happy relief, “a girl with your air and appearance,
not to speak of connections, ought to marry remarkably
well.”</p>

<p>Apparently I was about to be specially exported
to India in order to be launched on the marriage
market! That was my aunt’s idea. My own was
otherwise. I would be within hail of my beloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Ronnie, and far away from the anxieties and embarrassments
which encompassed me at Torrington.
With a view to a good talk and to learn my immediate
requirements I went to tea at the Dower
House, where I found only Mrs. Paget-Taylor and
Mrs. Hayes-Billington. As I sat beside the latter
on the sofa I was nearly overpowered by the perfume
of some heavy Eastern scent, and at close
quarters noticed that the lady’s face was a little
made up and careworn. On her part, she was examining
me with an unmistakably critical expression
in her lovely eyes.</p>

<p>“I hear you ride well and are fond of dancing,
Miss Lingard, so we will keep a pony for you,” she
said. “We start next month, and as we arrive out
there in the monsoon you and I will go to the hills
together, whilst Bertie, poor boy, must return to
those detestable mines.”</p>

<p>I had not the faintest idea of what a “monsoon”
might be, but did not venture to display
my ignorance by making inquiries.</p>

<p>“We are going out by a cheap liner if you don’t
mind,” she continued, “first class to Bombay only
forty pounds. We are obliged to be economical.
Your expenses on to Silliram will come to about
a hundred rupees. Unfortunately, we arrive in the
rains, but, you see, Bertie’s leave has expired and it
cannot be avoided.”</p>

<p>She then proceeded to give a long list of my requirements,
which Mrs. Paget-Taylor precisely entered
in a little notebook. It seemed that I should require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
a saddle and bridle, a thick and thin habit, warm
clothes, cool clothes, smart clothes, cushions, a folding
chair, a good supply of scented soap, sheets, towels, a
tea-basket, heaps of silk underwear, silk stockings,
and also golf and tennis requisites.</p>

<p>Armed with this list I returned to my aunt. I
felt a certain diffidence about handing over such a
long array of wants, but she seemed to look upon the
matter as a mere bagatelle and even added several
items. She also informed me that I had (as I knew)
an income of £150 a year of my own. This would
go to the Hayes-Billingtons, to pay for board and
lodging, and as their funds were low she had agreed
to lodge the first six months in advance, also she
and my uncle had decided to make me an allowance
of an additional hundred a year for clothes and
my personal expenses. This was generous treatment,
and I thanked her warmly. Now that I was actually
departing, placing seas and continents between us,
Aunt Mina had become semi-attached to me, and
it may seem mean of me to add that I believe she
scattered this liberality and largesse as sacrifice and
thank-offering, and, as it were, the price of Bev.</p>

<p>My aunt accompanied me to London to select my
outfit, which was ordered on the most lavish scale; in
fact, I would be justified in calling it a trousseau!
When the preparations were well <i>en train</i> she left me
to spend two or three days with Lizzie in the flat, and
to be taken by her to undergo my various fittings.</p>

<p>I found Lizzie comfortably installed, looking
years younger than she had done at Beke, and quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
smart. She gave me to understand that Mr. Chesterfield,
the rector, had urged her to marry him, first
by letter, indeed letters; and, as these proved unsuccessful,
he had actually come to London and
figuratively prostrated himself at her feet, announcing
that “he was lost without her, and had never
realised her priceless value until she was gone!
She was sorely missed everywhere and really must
recall her decision and return to Beke as Mrs.
Chesterfield.”</p>

<p>“I told him,” said Lizzie, “that I knew how he
had leaned upon me and that under other circumstances
I would gladly have become his wife, but now
it was impossible. Mrs. Puckle was the obstacle.
He might think me unchristian if he liked, but I
could not breathe in the same parish with that
woman.”</p>

<p>So much for Lizzie’s affairs, and with respect
to mine she said: “Eva, I do hope you will never
regret this step. I know you have always longed
to go to India and I must confess I envy you. I too
would like to flap and spread my wings. But you
ought to go out under proper auspices. <i>Who</i> are these
Hayes-Billingtons?”</p>

<p>She had met them at Rumpelmayers, and somehow
they had not coalesced. Mrs. Hayes-Billington was
lofty in her manner, and inclined to be condescending
to Miss Lingard’s late governess&mdash;who scrutinised that
very beautiful chaperon with keenly observant eyes.</p>

<p>“He may be Mrs. Paget-Taylor’s cousin, but these
Hayes-Billingtons are not in your class&mdash;hard up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
and pretentious. I may be quite wrong, but the man
looks as if he drank, and the woman, although undoubtedly
handsome, is so made up. My dear Eva,
your aunt must be desperately anxious to get rid
of you! If the worst happens cable to me and
come back to the flat. I am not sure that your
little skiff is sufficiently weather-tight to battle among
the waves of Indian society.”</p>

<p>“I know you are a good judge of character,
Lizzie, and before I ‘take to the water’ I wish you
would tell me something about myself. You have
carte blanche to say what you like&mdash;I shall not be
offended.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will be no news to you that you have
a strong will, and heaps of vitality and staying power;
are naturally impulsive and much too talkative,
also, in a way, deceptive. Your real feelings are not
easily moved, and, except for sick people and animals,
your heart is rather hard.”</p>

<p>“Oh Lizzie!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Oh Eva!” she echoed. “This is, in a way,
true. When you dislike a person it is for always.
For instance, nothing would ever make you really
care for your aunt and Clara; or at Beke for Mr.
Chesterfield and Eliza the cook. On the other
hand, your affections are staunch and unchangeable,
you idealise your friends far beyond their deserts,
and refuse to see a single flaw in their characters.
Take, for example, Ronnie. To you he is absolutely
perfect, a sort of little god; if it came to a pinch I
believe you would make <i>any</i> sacrifice for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered stoutly, “any&mdash;and glad of
the chance!”</p>

<p>“Ronnie is a good sort and fond of you, but
he is by no means a stable character. Yours is by
far the stronger of the two.”</p>

<p>“Lizzie, how can you talk such nonsense?”</p>

<p>“It is the truth, and you may have occasion
to realise it yet. With you it is all or nothing, and
when you fall in love I confess I shall feel anxious&mdash;you
will give so much, and may receive so little.
Well, there, no one can help you! Fate shuffles the
cards and you have yet to meet your destiny. Shall
I give you one or two scraps of worldly advice, my
dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” I urged eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, when you go into the big world be
careful how you choose your associates; people are
judged by their friends.”</p>

<p>“Are they? I should not have thought so.”</p>

<p>“Try, if you can, not to talk of yourself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll do my best, but I have not much
else to talk about, have I?”</p>

<p>“There will be plenty of topics once you are out
of your little groove. In Vanity Fair I dare say
you may receive a share of knocks and bruises among
others hustling in the market-place, but whatever
these may be do not show them! All I am advising
is simply worldly wisdom, and my most urgent important
injunction comes last: do not give your
confidence to every agreeable woman, or your heart
to the first insidious and good-looking man who gazes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
into your eyes, and tells you that you are pretty
and a darling. Wait and look round, for with you
to love, is for always.”</p>

<p>I felt unexpectedly embarrassed; my face felt hot,
as I listened to these intimate personal directions,
and I hastened to turn the conversation to Beke
and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>In answer to my questions Lizzie informed me that
her uncle had taken over the whole of “The Roost,”
and paid her a rental of twenty pounds a year. The
house was now occupied by Mrs. Puckle’s married
daughter and her three children; with long visitations
from Mrs. Puckle’s actor son when&mdash;as so frequently
happened&mdash;he found himself “out of a shop.”</p>

<p>The new mistress kept pigs, the garden was converted
into a poultry run, the mulberry tree and
others had been cut down and sold. According to
Mr. Chesterfield the establishment was a continual
scene of animosity and wrangling, and the professor’s
beard was as white as snow!</p>

<p>“At one time,” added Lizzie, “I would have asked
for nothing better than to live my life and end my
days in Beke, but, as you know, I have been driven
forth by my aunt by marriage!”</p>

<span>THE “ASPHODEL”</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">During</span> my stay in London I saw a good deal of
Mrs. Hayes-Billington; her husband had been hastily
summoned to his mines and she was alone, awaiting
my company in the <i>Asphodel</i>, in which we had
secured passages. My future chaperon would often
drop in at the flat to offer advice respecting my
luggage and boxes, or to arrange for meetings at
dressmakers. She exhibited a lively interest in my
frocks and invariably accompanied me to be fitted.
It struck me as strange&mdash;or rather I believe Lizzie
suggested the idea&mdash;that such a handsome and
fashionable woman should appear to have so much
time on her hands. Apparently she had taken a
fancy to me, called me by my Christian name, and was
far more demonstrative than my late governess,
who had known me since I was a fretful little creature
aged four years. Mrs. Hayes-Billington was also
her reverse in another respect, as she fed me with
a certain amount of flattery. This was indeed a
novelty and I must honestly confess that I was not
averse to such nectar in small doses, but from huge
spoonfuls I instinctively recoiled.</p>

<p>One day I had been enduring the trying on of a
lovely white evening frock, and the fitter had left the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
room in search of some ribbon; as I stood before the
long glass contemplating my appearance Mrs. Hayes-Billington
suddenly rose, put her arm round my neck,
and gazing at my reflection exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Do you know, my dear, that you are <i>lovely</i>!”</p>

<p>Before I could protest she continued:</p>

<p>“I think we shall make rather a striking pair,
you and I&mdash;such a complete contrast. I with my
gipsy face, you with your masses of golden brown
hair and sunny blue-grey eyes&mdash;sometimes they
are angel-praying eyes, and sometimes I see a little
devil dancing in each of them! Then, and above
all, my dear, you look such an aristocrat.”</p>

<p>It was an enormous relief to me when the return
of the forewoman and skirt hand put an end to these
embarrassing and exaggerated compliments.</p>

<p>Ten days later we sailed from Tilbury Docks.
I was seen off by my uncle and aunt, Lizzie, Beverley,
young Champneys and two schoolfellows who happened
to be in London; my cabin, which I shared with
Mrs. Hayes-Billington, was packed with books,
flowers, and large boxes of my favourite sweets.
I must here confess, hard-hearted creature as I was,
that I left my native land with composure. I should
add, however, that since I had come to woman’s
estate I was not much given to weeping, but, on the
other hand, Mrs. Hayes-Billington, in a voice choked
with emotion, large tears trembling in her splendid
eyes, assured my aunt and uncle that she would be
a <i>mother</i> to me.</p>

<p>Our steamer, the <i>Asphodel</i>, corresponded with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
passage money in every particular. She looked,
and was, cheap, and I think I may add, nasty.
The smell of oil from the engine-room almost
overpowered the salt sea air, and the saloon reeked
of new mahogany and stale sherry. The cabins
were small and stuffy. There were but two bathrooms
for the first-class passengers, who luckily
were few and far between: chiefly individuals like
the Hayes-Billingtons who had squandered most of
their money when on furlough; one or two railway
officials, several planters, and half a dozen
missionaries; nothing approaching the smart crowd
that one heard or read of as passengers to the
East. For one thing, we were outward bound
at the wrong time of year; and for another,
we had booked by an unfashionable line. There
were no dances, no games; the piano was a derelict;
but the weather and the novelty consoled me
for all deficiencies.</p>

<p>As we coasted down by Spain and put in at
Gibraltar and Malta, and endured the usual coaling
agony at Port Said, it seemed to me that I was seeing
the world at last! Mrs. Hayes-Billington and I
shared the same cabin. Here I also shared some
of the secrets of her toilet; to do her justice she
had no false shame, and allowed me to know that
certain portions of her hair and complexion were
artificial; nevertheless, much of her beauty was
<i>bona fide</i>. Living at such close quarters I realised
that she was considerably older than I had supposed,
and, in spite of some wonderful grease that she applied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
at night, there were wrinkles round her eyes and
lines upon her forehead.</p>

<p>I always rose first, in order to clear out of the
cabin and give my companion lots of elbow room for
dressing. The operation was a lengthy one, and she
rarely appeared on deck before twelve o’clock, but,
on the other hand, she seldom descended to her
berth till after midnight.</p>

<p>Among our fellow passengers she had discovered
an old acquaintance in a good-looking officer of the
frontier force. His name was Colonel Armadale;
he sat next her at meal times, his chair was with ours
on deck. They promenaded for hours at a time,
and occasionally disappeared into a particular lair
of their own somewhere about the bows of the ship.
Mrs. Hayes-Billington carefully explained to me that
Colonel Armadale’s sister was her very oldest friend,
which fact naturally drew them a good deal together,
and this was not their sole tie. They had been in
the same station in the Punjaub, and had many
acquaintances and topics in common. Her friend
was always polite and attentive to me, carried my
rug, moved my chair, and occasionally included me
in the conversation. Once or twice I caught his
eyes gazing at me with a curious, interrogative
expression. What did it mean?</p>

<p>As he had, to a great extent, appropriated the
society of my chaperon, I was more or less
thrown upon my own resources. At first the other
womenkind seemed to hold aloof from me, but before
long I found myself received into the bosom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
missionary circle. There was a kindly white-bearded
gentleman and his wife who were going to Assam,
and one tall, distinguished woman travelling alone,
<i>en route</i> to join her husband in Upper Burmah. Her
name was Mrs. Ashe, and she and I became comrades,
paced the deck together, exchanged books and new
stitches in lace work. Her spirits were depressed,
as she had just left two small children at home, but
presently she cheered up and gave me a great deal
of useful information respecting the country to
which I was bound. Undoubtedly Mrs. Ashe belonged
to my own class, though I may honestly say it was
not for this reason that I made friends with her.
She informed me that her father had been the general
commanding a division in Northern India. There
she had met a zealous young Oxford parson, cast in
her lot with him, and departed to work in the mission
field, to the stupefaction and horror of her family.
“It has turned out all right,” she added. “Julian
and I are very happy. Our only trouble is in having
to be separated from the kiddies.”</p>

<p>For my own part I imparted abundant information
about myself, and told her that I had no parents,
no real home, and was going to India in order
to be within reach of my brother, also because
the family doctor advised that I should spend the
winters in a warm climate.</p>

<p>“And Mrs. Hayes-Billington is taking charge
of you on the voyage?”</p>

<p>“By no means,” I replied, “she is in charge of me
altogether. I am to live with them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>

<p>For quite an appreciable time Mrs. Ashe was
speechless. At last she said:</p>

<p>“But how on earth did your people come across
her?”</p>

<p>“Captain Hayes-Billington is distantly connected
with some friends. The Hayes-Billingtons were
looking for a paying guest, I was anxious to go to
India, my aunt liked Mrs. Hayes-Billington&mdash;and
so here I am.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashe said no more on this subject, but I
gathered that she did not approve of my chaperon,
also that the feeling was mutual. The two ladies
“looked down their noses” on the rare occasions
when they met face to face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashe and I had many talks as we sat together
on deck on lovely moonlight nights. Steaming
down the Red Sea the water was like glass, but
no sooner had we left Aden than I learnt the meaning
of the word “monsoon.” Directly we abandoned
the shelter of the coast we were struck by the full
force of what to me seemed a hurricane. It burst
upon us suddenly at luncheon time; at the first
lurch of the <i>Asphodel</i> all the knives and plates and
glasses slid off the table, and oh! how we rolled
and wallowed! We rolled all the way over to
Bombay, the rain descended in torrents, and the
knocking about, the clinging, and the crawling were
horribly uncomfortable. Our <i>Asphodel</i> was what is
called “a wet boat,” her decks were continually
swept by seas, and she groaned and shuddered like
some stricken animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p>I must confess that I was by no means sorry
when the voyage came to an end and we stepped
upon the Ballard Pier, in the animated and highly
coloured city of Bombay. Here we did not delay
more than a few hours, which we spent at the Taj
Mahal Hotel, and then drove to Victoria Station to
pursue our journey.</p>

<p>Bombay gave me my first sight of the ancient and
picturesque East. I was fascinated by the quaint
native craft at the quays, the crowds of people in gay
and varied costumes, the painted bullock carts,
the jingling trams packed so tightly, the fine imposing
public buildings and the beautiful bay&mdash;“Bon
Bahia” indeed!</p>

<p>The ascent of the great Bore Ghât was to me a
most thrilling and impressive experience. How we
went up, up, up, and how we went down, down, down!
What dizzy views of the plains as we crept along
precipices and turned the most paralysing angles!
Finally, after steady travelling by rail and tonga,
we found ourselves at our journey’s end&mdash;the hill
station of Silliram.</p>

<p>It was pouring the traditional “cats and dogs”
when we arrived, and here Captain Hayes-Billington
awaited us at the tonga office, his broad, good-looking
face wet with rain and wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>It appeared that he had secured a small bungalow,
collected a few servants, and done, he declared, “his
best to give us a flying start.” The bungalow, which
was named “The Dovecot,” was old and dilapidated,
surrounded by a deep veranda and a small garden or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
compound which separated us from a high road,
at present swimming in mud. Accommodation in
“The Dovecot” consisted of four rooms, viz. drawing-room,
dining-room and two bedrooms, to each of
which was attached a ruinous bathroom; for tub, a
half barrel of primitive age. The smaller of the
bedrooms was naturally apportioned to me, and
here, with the aid of an English-speaking ayah, I
began to unpack my small baggage and endeavoured
to make myself at home. Coming across from
Aden I had learnt the true meaning of the word
“monsoon.” Arriving in Silliram, I received a
practical illustration of the word “rains!”</p>

<p>It was not merely rain, but a cataract that
battered on the roof, roared down the gutters and
made large ponds in our little compound. Silliram
was situated on a spur of the ghâts about 4,000 feet
above the plains, but for the moment one could
see nothing of the place. The atmosphere appeared
to consist entirely of a wet white mist; the roads
were ankle deep in red mud, the valleys filled
with masses of what looked like cotton-wool clouds.
Europeans on ponies and disguised in mackintoshes
occasionally splashed by our gate, and the natives
went about with long bare legs, the remainder of
their persons entirely shrouded in brown blankets.</p>

<p>It was now that I began to see the best side of
Captain Hayes-Billington. Always loud and boisterous,
he was nevertheless wonderfully good-tempered,
cheerful and considerate, and eagerly disposed to
make the best of everything. He was also sur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>prisingly
energetic, and helped his wife and myself
to furbish up our shabby little bungalow. I gathered
that we might soon expect a number of visitors, but
that it was our business, being the last comers, to
sally forth and call upon the station.</p>

<p>We made an expedition to the native bazaar
during a few hours’ “break,” waded about from shop to
shop, and picked up some necessities and odds and
ends of decorations wherewith to furnish our abode.
We bought bamboo chairs, phoolcarries, and pallampores;
muslin for curtains; crockery, mats, a few cheap
rugs, and a couple of reliable lamps. We also&mdash;oh,
great adventure!&mdash;hired a piano. I stood by awestruck
whilst Mrs. Hayes-Billington bargained and
gesticulated&mdash;talking all the while in the most fluent
Hindustani, and ruthlessly cheapening every article.
Meanwhile, her husband looked on, now and then
making suggestions, indicating deficiencies, and exhibiting
the deepest interest in every transaction.</p>

<p>With the fruits of this excursion the Hayes-Billingtons
at once set to work to “do up” the rickety
old bungalow, to which undertaking I gladly lent
a hand. Somehow it reminded me of dressing a
stage for private theatricals, such as we had at school.
The dreary, damp little drawing-room, its walls
streaked with green, was now hung with stamped
cotton; the mouldy matting was replaced, and gay
rugs laid here and there. Bamboo furniture, a
couple of second-hand chairs, a black and gold table,
and a paper screen effected a grand transformation.</p>

<p>I contributed photographs in silver frames, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
books and silk cushions, to help in the embellishment,
and with flowers and a couple of lamp shades we all
agreed that the little room was “quite top hole.”</p>

<p>We also made a few alterations in the dining-room,
cast out the rotten matting and some broken
chairs, and now considered ourselves in a position
to receive company. I had taken part in all these
arrangements <i>con amore</i>, for I realised that I had
thrown in my lot with the Hayes-Billingtons, and
was bound to consider myself as one of the family.
In a way, I liked them both; he, strange to say, the
better of the two. He was always so cheery, optimistic
and busy. He told me he had heard of a smart
pony that he was going to buy for me by and by, and
said I must ask my brother to run up soon and pay
us a visit. For her part she did her best to make me
comfortable and to break the shock of squalid appointments,
the, to me, unusual cooking&mdash;and undesirable
insects! I could see that she was anxious we should
mix in society and that I should have what she
called “a really festive time.”</p>

<p>“You must know, my dear girl,” she explained,
“I am as much a stranger in this part of the world as
yourself. I have always been up north, where the
natives, the climate, and the manners and customs are
altogether different. I shall certainly miss our nice
cold weather, but as Bertie has got this good appointment
in the Deccan that will be some compensation.
He is obliged to go down in a few days, so you and
I will have to take care of one another,” and she
put her arm round my neck and kissed me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span></p>

<p>In spite of her endearments and affection I
always realised that there was a certain amount
of reserve about my chaperon. She never talked
of the past, except in a general way, but greatly
preferred to throw herself into the future&mdash;especially
my future&mdash;which was kind of her!</p>

<p>I did not grumble audibly or make disparaging
comments, but so far, with regard to India, I was
painfully disillusioned and overwhelmed with disappointment.
As I sat in the driest spot I could
find in a leaking veranda I asked myself, where was
the sun? Was this wet, cloudy country the gorgeous
East? We had been five whole days at Silliram
and as yet it had never ceased to rain. Captain
Hayes-Billington had paddled out as far as the club
and library, put down our names for both, brought
back some news, and cheered us with promises of
finer weather.</p>

<p>“This is just an extraordinarily bad break they
say,” he announced with a broad smile; “but the
glass is going up and we shall have the sun out and
everything all right to-morrow or next day.”</p>

<p>The servants ministering to “The Dovecot”
were a strange and motley crew. The butler was a
Portuguese half-caste from Goa, who had previously
been in the service of Captain Hayes-Billington; the
Mohammedan cook, a bearded individual in a red
turban. My English-speaking Madrassee ayah was
sympathetic and even motherly; she turned out the
frogs that hopped about my room, destroyed several
promising nests of white ants, and slew a venomous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>-looking
black scorpion. The old woman informed
me that she had been twice to England with ladies
and children.</p>

<p>“England,” she said, “plenty good food, good
beer but plenty much stairs; journey there very
bad, specially the Biscay river, too much jumping
that Biscay river!”</p>

<p>I gathered that she was considerably impressed
by the style and quantity of my outfit; but, on the
other hand, she openly despised the bungalow.</p>

<p>“This too much bad bungalow,” she declared,
“too old, too cheap, too far from bazaar and the
club gur, and all the big mem sahibs.”</p>

<p>But of this drawback I had not yet had an opportunity
of judging.</p>

<p>By the end of a week Captain Hayes-Billington
had taken his departure. His wife seemed unaffectedly
sorry; I think they were really attached
to one another&mdash;almost like a newly-married couple.</p>

<p>They had one rather irritating habit: that of
conversing in Hindustani. They spoke it fluently,
although they assured me that they had got very
rusty at home and were now talking it for practice.
Occasionally I had an instinctive and disagreeable
feeling that sometimes, in my very presence,
they were discussing <i>me</i>!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_11">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span>A HILL STATION</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Captain Hayes-Billington</span>’s prediction was fulfilled;
a welcome “break” brought us perfect weather,
and at last we were enabled to dispense with umbrellas
and goloshes, and sally forth to see the place.
Silliram was situated on a high plateau, and, as we
emerged from a by-path and stood near a celebrated
“point,” a world of absolute peace and beauty lay
beneath us. The precipices which overhung the low
country were heavily wooded and clothed with
masses of trees, flowering creepers, orchids and a
luxuriant variety of gigantic exotic ferns. The
plains which stretched so far below resembled a
faintly coloured map, or some delicate piece of embroidery,
gradually fading away into a misty blue
distance. The atmosphere after the rains was so
extraordinarily crystal-clear that we could see for
miles, and even trace the outlines of distant towns,
forests and rivers. Overhead a few lazy clouds
threw their shadows on the wonderful scene, possibly
jealous of such beauty and endeavouring to
obscure it.</p>

<p>It was no doubt owing to its lofty situation that
Silliram dried up rapidly; the roads were no longer
merely red mud, the cascades of running water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
ceased to brawl, and the all-reviving sun had apparently
brought the whole population into the open
air&mdash;also their wardrobes. In almost every compound
one noticed long strings of male and female
garments fluttering in the breeze.</p>

<p>After our walk to the view Mrs. Hayes-Billington
and I bravely ventured into the club. Among the
crowd each face we saw was that of a stranger.
Apparently we were the only outsiders, everyone else
seemed to be acquainted.</p>

<p>I took courage from my chaperon, who was
evidently well used to Indian clubs and club ways,
and securing seats and a table she issued an order
for tea and bread and butter.</p>

<p>“Not buffalo butter,” she amended imperiously.</p>

<p>I noticed a number of girls, various soldierly-looking
young men, some few matrons and oldish
officers with grey hairs, but no really elderly people.
There was bridge, badminton in a covered court,
tennis, a reading-room and a supply of refreshments.
I could not but see that we were observed
with interest; who would not look at Mrs. Hayes-Billington?
She was unusually animated and in
good spirits, and we sat over our tea cups for some
time absorbed in our surroundings, enjoying this
pleasant change from our damp little “Dovecot.”</p>

<p>As we walked back Mrs. Hayes-Billington
remarked:</p>

<p>“To-morrow I will order a conveyance of some
sort, we will put on our smartest frocks and pay a
round of calls from twelve to two. Bertie got a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
list from the club baboo. We will begin with the
general’s wife, the commissioner’s wife, the padre’s
wife, and so on. I think I had better write your
name on my cards, and then everyone will know
that we are living together and that you are under
my wing.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I assented, “of course, that will be best.”</p>

<p>“I hope they will all be out; this calling is a
mere matter of form. As soon as visits have been
exchanged, we shall be invited to the general’s at
homes, the club dances, picnics and tennis parties,
and you will have no end of a good time.”</p>

<p>The following morning, arrayed in our best afternoon
frocks, we started out in an ancient victoria to
make our round of calls&mdash;in short, “to wait upon the
station.” The general’s wife and daughter were at
home. They proved to be charming people, and the girl,
who was my age, and I took to one another on the
spot. Our other calls were more or less satisfactory;
we dropped our names into the many “Not at home”
boxes, and having dispersed twenty cards returned
to “The Dovecot” and tiffin, in a condition of
complete exhaustion.</p>

<p>The result of our effort was an immediate shower of
pasteboards or visitors, and we were soon in the midst
of a whirl of hill gaiety. We went to tennis parties,
picnics, and dances. My companion was impressively
sedate and correct in her manner&mdash;this was not the
Mrs. Hayes-Billington with whom I had travelled
in the <i>Asphodel</i>! She was also an admirable bridge
and tennis player, had an unfailing supply of agree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>able
small talk, and was one of the most popular
married women in the station.</p>

<p>My chaperon was an excellent manager, and
thoroughly understood Anglo-Indian housekeeping
and the art of cutting down the cook’s accounts. We
lived carefully and economically, but nevertheless
entertained in a quiet way; we gave little tiffins and
dinners before a club dance, to young men and girls&mdash;though
our dining-room was a crush with six. On
these occasions the table was beautifully decorated
by Mrs. Hayes-Billington, and some of the sweets and
the savouries were made by her on a handy charcoal
stove in the back veranda. She had a deft way of
doing things; everything turned out by her delicate
fingers seemed so dainty and complete, whether it was
a toque, a pincushion, or some toothsome dish. Although
Mrs. Hayes-Billington invariably spoke of herself
as “a genteel pauper,” I had a shrewd impression
that once upon a time she had been accustomed
to wealth and luxury. Her wardrobe was plain
and inexpensive, but she possessed beautiful lace,
the remains of various gorgeous gowns, a gold-mounted
dressing-bag which had evidently seen much
service, a string of pearls and remarkably fine
diamonds. Also she was a notable dressmaker,
and refurbished and altered some of the satins and
brocades, with the aid of a clever <i>dirzee</i>; he sat in the
veranda from morning till night, sewing, pinning,
copying, making marvellous use of his toes for holding
breadths of stuff, and was armed with the most
formidable pair of scissors I had ever beheld.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span></p>

<p>The outcome of these exertions were picturesque
teagowns and evening toilettes, gracefully worn by
Mrs. Hayes-Billington at our weekly bridge party,
when young men dropped in after dinner for a
rubber and a smoke.</p>

<p>On such occasions I did not take a hand; the
stakes were too high and the rubbers were so long&mdash;sometimes
the clock struck one before I heard the
break-up of the party. In a house like ours, with
the walls possibly made of old packing-cases, every
sound was audible.</p>

<p>My chaperon was a first-rate bridge player;
she smoked unlimited cigarettes, used slangy expressions
and was more at ease and in “mental undress”
than Aunt Mina would have approved. However,
she was undoubtedly happy; as I watched her
eager radiant face I could not help thinking of some
poor pot-bound thirsty flower that had at last received
freedom and moisture!</p>

<p>The young men worshipped my companion; no
doubt they were flattered by her notice and her
sympathetic manner; she was always so beautiful,
so vital and so gay. Once or twice I found myself
wondering at what she saw in <i>them</i>. They were very
young and, even in my callow opinion, rather dull
and uninteresting. I came upon the answer to this
question (if answer it was) in rather an unexpected
form. One morning, after one of these weekly
parties, I happened to open the old bureau in order
to hunt for a piece of sealing-wax, and there, stuffed
under bridge markers, cards and scraps of paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
covered with figures, I discovered coins and notes
to the amount of three hundred rupees!</p>

<p>I must confess that the find was a shock. I had
never seen what is called “real gambling.” Was this
the first nod from our family skeleton, or was it
merely the housekeeping funds accidentally muddled
up with cards and paper? Mrs. Hayes-Billington
was so foolishly careless of money and jewellery, and
rarely kept them under lock and key. The only
possessions she ever locked up were her letters.</p>

<p>The general’s daughter and I became companions
and fast friends. We went sketching together,
though our poor attempts were libels on the wonderful
scenery we attempted to transfer to paper.
Besides Dolly Dane there were numbers of nice
girls in the station. For instance, Belinda and
Sylvia Brabazon, known as “Billy” and “Silly”&mdash;for
India is no respecter of names!&mdash;a plain little
couple, matchless tennis players and cotillion leaders,
tirelessly good-natured and energetic. Their mother,
an amazingly vigorous matron, looked like their
elder sister. Colonel Brabazon’s activities were confined
to collecting butterflies, and telling “good”
stories in the club smoking-room. No picnics or dances
were considered complete without his belongings.</p>

<p>The commissioner’s wife, Mrs. Clayson, a kindly
but lethargic lady, was weighed down by the cares
of a large small family, and took no part save that of
spectator in any social gaieties. Then there were
Major and Mrs. Wray of the Grey Hussars, a particularly
smart couple, who enjoyed the reputation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
giving the best dinners in Silliram, to which none
but what I may call the “<i>crème de la crème</i>”
were invited.</p>

<p>I regret to add that Mrs. Wray figuratively
closed her doors on the commissariat, uncovenanted
and subordinate railway and telegraph service. She,
however, did not close her doors on us, but was Mrs.
Hayes-Billington’s chief friend, at which I was not
surprised, as there were certain points in common
between them. They had dealt at the same London
shops, employed the same Court milliner, used the
same soap, and were equally devoted to bridge.</p>

<p>In all my life I had never enjoyed myself so
thoroughly as during these weeks at an Indian hill
station. The weather was perfect; the clear exhilarating
mountain air raised my spirits to the highest pitch,
and when I woke in the morning it was always with
the feeling that something delightful was going
to happen during the day, and this sensation was
usually justified. I had hired a pony from the bazaar&mdash;fortunately
my new saddle fitted him perfectly&mdash;and
joined riding parties and picnics all over the
plateau. The hard red roads and overgrown lanes
wound among wonderful ferns and woods. Here
were my old friends the oak and the willow; the delicate
tamarind and stately peepul I now saw for the
first time. Our expeditions were generally to points
commanding clear-cut views of the far-away plains,
or the purple gloom of valleys beneath our feet. At
some of these “points” we had picnics, <i>chotah
hazree</i>, tiffin, or afternoon tea, as the case might be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>

<p>Besides such rural excursions there were tennis
tournaments, small club dances, and active preparations
for the great event of the season&mdash;theatricals,
which were got up by the general and his wife. The
piece selected, <i>The Scrap of Paper</i>, was undoubtedly
ambitious, but where is the amateur who does not
soar? The rôles of the Marquise and Suzanne were
undertaken by Mrs. Wray and Mrs. Hayes-Billington,
and the piece required constant rehearsal. As I
had been selected to take the small part of a servant
who comes in and dusts a chair, I was always
present, and, behind the scenes, was immensely
interested and entertained.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hayes-Billington’s performance filled me
with a glow of personal pride. My chaperon was
what might be called “a born actress.” It also
transpired that she had played in this piece on former
occasions.</p>

<p>Dolly Dane was cast for Mathilde, and as our
parts were insignificant we had the pleasure of looking
on and watching the others perform. Mrs. Hayes-Billington
was admirable, Mrs. Wray was also good.
In spite of their close friendship I thought I could
discern a certain amount of rivalry between these
ladies. The general himself, and one or two of
our most prominent young men, were in the cast.
The date of the great gala night was fixed to take
place within a fortnight, and after this, alas! the
season would begin to wane.</p>

<p>In almost every letter I sent to Ronnie I begged
him to come up and see Silliram and me, holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
out such inducements as <i>The Scrap of Paper</i> and
the Bachelors’ Club dance.</p>

<p>“I am longing to see you,” I said, “and also for
you to see me, and to judge how splendidly I am
getting on in India. Already I know a little Hindustani,
I can fold and put on a pugaree, and chaffer
with the hawkers as to the manner born.”</p>

<p>But my invitation fell flat. Ronnie wrote that
he could not possibly get leave; the rifle meeting
was coming on, also the polo tournament, and a
general inspection. He was simply worked to death.
Later he might be able to get away. Meanwhile he
was delighted to hear that I was having such a
ripping time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hayes-Billington and I had a good many
men callers; one day among these, Mr. Balthasar,
a friend of Captain Hayes-Billington, presented himself.
He was a foreigner&mdash;that is to say, not English.
His dark skin was in surprising contrast to a pair
of very light grey eyes, which he rolled about incessantly.
He had thick black lashes, a bullet head,
fat clean-shaven face, good features, beautiful hands
and a stout, supple figure. Also he was remarkably
well groomed and carried himself with an air of
confident assurance.</p>

<p>I noticed a slight hint of patronage in his manner
towards Mrs. Hayes-Billington, which, with a gracious
dignity, she speedily suppressed. He talked with a
sort of soft drawl, and informed us he had come
from the mines, and had just run up to Silliram
to confer with a well-known engineer, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
returning the following day. Our visitor paid me conspicuous
attention, his restless eyes constantly
rolled in my direction, and he accepted an invitation
to dine with flattering alacrity. When he had
departed in a motor Mrs. Hayes-Billington said:</p>

<p>“That is one of the directors of the Katchoocan
Gold Mines, where Bertie works; he is what is called
‘a big pot,’ notable for getting valuable concessions
from the Nizam’s Government. His call was
an honour. I believe he is a Greek&mdash;anyway, a
Levantine of some sort&mdash;and enormously rich. I
must send to the bazaar and the shops and prepare a
really smart dinner&mdash;oysters and pomfret, and get
some wine from the club, and a tin of caviare. If
I entertain him well it may be of use to Bertie. I
believe he plays bridge, so I shall ask another man,
Captain Learoyd, I think, and be sure you put on a
becoming frock.”</p>

<p>The little dinner proved a success; it was cooked
to admiration. The great man expanded and made
himself agreeable, and hinted that he would do
great things for “B.B.,” as he called Captain Hayes-Billington.
Subsequently at bridge I was his partner,
and I positively could not endure the way he stared&mdash;precisely
as if I were an uncertain investment
about which he was making up his mind. At the
same time he played bridge with skill; was cool, subtly
cunning, and had a clear memory of every card.
We won two rubbers, to his obvious satisfaction. He
and Captain Learoyd played for money, and I think
he pocketed about ten rupees, a mere nothing to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
millionaire, but he was as pleased as if it had been
thousands.</p>

<p>“I look upon our success as a good omen, Miss
Lingard. You and I are first-rate partners. How
would you like to take me on for life?” he asked
boisterously.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I replied brusquely, as I turned
my back upon him and moved away. I disliked Mr.
Balthasar particularly&mdash;his boasting, his grand air, the
way in which he looked round our cheap little room&mdash;and
appeared to see through our makeshifts&mdash;also
the style in which he had stuck his glass in his eye and
peered into the entrées at dinner. He was insupportable,
and after I had tidied away the bridge cards I
withdrew into my own apartment and put myself to
bed. It was a long time before I heard his motor
moving off, and immediately afterwards Mrs. Hayes-Billington
came into my room and said:</p>

<p>“He has been waiting on for <i>ages</i>! Why did
you go away and never come back?”</p>

<p>“Because he is too appallingly awful!” I rejoined
with energy. “I never saw such manners. I never
met such a detestable, odious creature. I felt inclined
to throw things at him, and I sincerely hope I may
never see him again!”</p>

<p>“He hopes very much that he may see <i>you</i> again.
He has taken an extraordinary fancy to ‘my friend
Miss Lingard,’ and says if I will bring you down to
stay at the mines he will put us up&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He will never put <i>me</i> up,” I interrupted, “and
nothing would induce me to put up with him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span></p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Hayes-Billington stood gravely
contemplating me with her wonderful dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah well,” she said at last, “I grant you that he
is a bounder, but then on the other hand he is
enormously rich.”</p>

<p>“My dear chaperon!” I exclaimed, “surely you
are not thinking of trying to make a match for
me with a fat foreigner who must be fifty years
of age! I would rather be dead than married to such
a horror!”</p>

<p>She nodded her head expressively and went slowly
out of the room.</p>

<p>As a rule our young men callers were officers
upon leave, a nice, cheery set, my partners at dances
and tennis. We were always at home on Sunday
afternoons, and Mrs. Hayes-Billington and I were
most regular attendants at the little hill church in
the mornings. One particular afternoon two of our
habitués brought a stranger, a certain Captain Vesey.
Somehow he was not of the usual type of our visitors,
who were simple, unaffected, and genial. This was
a fair man, with a long, faded face and a querulous
expression. After the first introduction he appeared
to freeze into a solid block of ice, and was reserved
almost to silence. I noticed him looking hard at
Mrs. Hayes-Billington, and, although he reclined in
a well-cushioned cane chair and was offered the very
best orange pekoe tea and hot cakes, he scarcely
contributed a word to the conversation and was
obviously dissatisfied with his company and his
surroundings. Possibly my name had escaped him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
for when someone addressed me as “Miss Lingard”
he became faintly interested.</p>

<p>“I know a namesake of yours in the ‘Lighthearts.’
Any relation?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered shortly, “he is my brother.”</p>

<p>“Your <i>brother</i>,” he repeated incredulously.</p>

<p>“Is it so very astonishing?”</p>

<p>“Um&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;” he stammered, “I had no idea
that Ronnie Lingard had a sister out here.”</p>

<p>“I only arrived six weeks ago&mdash;I came with Mrs.
Hayes-Billington.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you?”</p>

<p>“I wanted Ronnie to come here for even a week,
but he is so busy and so hard-worked he says it is
impossible.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes&mdash;impossible&mdash;quite, quite impossible,”
he muttered, as if talking to himself, and then he got
up rather suddenly and took an abrupt departure.</p>

<p>There was certainly something strange about
Captain Vesey. He had forgotten his gloves and he
had not touched his tea. The two young men who
had brought him exchanged glances and grins and
one of them exclaimed: “Sunstroke!”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mind him, Mrs. Hayes-Billington,”
he added apologetically, “but Vesey is the most
eccentric old bird.”</p>

<p>“So it seems,” she rejoined with a laugh, “and
I have not the slightest wish to put salt on his
tail!”</p>

<p>The great day of our theatricals was approaching.
The evening before it took place we had a full-dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
rehearsal&mdash;a <i>répétition générale</i>, French fashion&mdash;at the
theatre, to which at least half of the people came,
bidden or unbidden, but everyone was more or less
interested in the performance. If they were not
acting their friends or relations were taking part,
or they had lent properties, garments, furniture,
or given assistance in dressing and making up.</p>

<p>The little theatre was almost full. I made this
discovery by peeping through that indispensable hole
in the curtain. Mrs. Dane, the general’s wife, was
already seated in the middle of the front row, and
with her was a lady, a rather austere-looking, middle-aged
woman whom I had never seen before, also
a grey-haired gentleman, presumably her husband.
I may add that the <i>crème de la crème</i> of the station
were present at this rehearsal, but every one of
them would be there the next evening, honourably
paying their ten rupees a ticket. Rather a
high price, but then it was for a local charity.</p>

<p>I must admit that I was highly excited, being
about to make my first appearance on the stage.
I dressed myself as a smart parlourmaid; my face
had been beautifully painted by Major Wray&mdash;who
was quite an artist in this line&mdash;and I was ready!</p>

<p>After some delay the curtain rose on Mathilde
and her companion. Dolly acquitted herself well (although
she had been nearly crying with stage fright).
I had helped to attire the Marquise; she looked
magnificent and wore her diamonds. Having played
my own little part and accomplished my dusting I
went round to the front to enjoy the performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span></p>

<p>The good-natured Brabazons made room for me
between them in the second row, just behind Mrs.
Dane and the general, who turned about to compliment
me. At this moment the Marquise appeared
upon the stage, and received a round of applause.
I noticed the strange lady in front examining
her programme and whispering to her husband;
then she turned her attention to the actors, and
looked at the Marquise (the cynosure of all eyes)
with a sort of fixed glare. The play was going
splendidly, the prompter’s voice was rarely heard.
The chief honours fell to my chaperon, whose
acting was simply magnificent.</p>

<p>During the interval between the second and third
acts, I noticed Mrs. Dane and the strange lady
engaged in earnest conversation, and caught the
name “Mrs. de Lacy.” I also observed that Mrs.
Dane seemed very much perturbed and upset.</p>

<p><i>The Scrap of Paper</i> ended in a triumph. There
were repeated calls before the curtain, which were
accepted by the Marquise and Suzanne, who appeared,
curtsied hand in hand, and received a
boisterous ovation. This delightful evening concluded
with a little supper-party at the Wrays’,
and it was long after one o’clock in the morning
before I found myself in bed.</p>

<p>As the result of such dissipation I was not a
very early riser&mdash;neither was Mrs. Hayes-Billington.
Verbal messages are uncertain in India, and even
to someone in the same house you send a pencilled
note or “chit.” I had received a chit to say “Have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
an awful headache, do not expect to see me till
quite late. D. B.”</p>

<p>I spent the remainder of the morning in writing
letters, doing a little mending, and finishing an engrossing
novel. At tiffin, of which I partook in solitude,
the <i>chokra</i> was my sole attendant, and when
I inquired for Fernandez, our factotum, he replied,
“Missie done send Fernandez with one telegram.
Fernandez stopping all the time in bazaar.”</p>

<p>As our letters had arrived, I concluded that my
chaperon had received some important news, and
never gave the matter another thought.</p>

<p>Strange to say that morning there were none
of the usual visitors; a certain number of our intimates
and neighbours generally looked in, in passing,
to ask questions, make engagements, exchange bits
of news, and to borrow or to lend. To-day not
a soul appeared! The veranda was a desert, save
for the <i>dirzee</i> and myself. This did not strike me
as odd, because most people of our acquaintance
were fagged after the previous night’s excitement,
and were no doubt “lying low” in anticipation of
the evening’s entertainment.</p>

<p>Towards four o’clock I put on my tennis shoes,
took my racket and sauntered off to the club,
where I had engaged to make up a set with Dolly
Dane. I found already awaiting me Dolly, Captain
Learoyd and the padre. I noticed that they were
talking eagerly together, but ceased abruptly as I
approached within earshot, and there seemed none
of the usual eagerness about starting a game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<p>“What is the matter?” I asked. “You all
look so very grave. Is anyone dead&mdash;or has there
been an accident?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;er&mdash;no accident,” said the padre, and
he glanced significantly at Dolly, who, taking my
arm, led me aside.</p>

<p>“My dear Eva,” she began. “I am sorry to say
I’ve the most <i>awful</i> thing to tell you,” and she paused.</p>

<p>“Oh do be quick!” I urged. “It’s my brother&mdash;is
he ill?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she replied, with a jerk of impatience.
“It’s about Mrs. Hayes-Billington, your chaperon.
It seems that she is the heroine of a terrible divorce
case. She was a Mrs. de Lacy; her husband had a
civil appointment up in the Punjab. She was always
lovely, but outrageously fast. Four years ago she
ran away with an officer up in Cashmere. Mrs.
Hancock, who is staying with us, knew all about it
and nearly had a fit last evening when she saw the
notorious Mrs. de Lacy taking the principal part in
Mother’s theatricals.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dolly,” I gasped, “it cannot be true!”</p>

<p>“But it is,” she reiterated, “and the case was so
scandalous and shameless, that the Hancocks are
astonished that she had the audacity ever to return
to India. They say she is already beginning in her
old style, turning the heads of young men, and having
horrid little card parties. It is a fearful shock for
the whole station. Mother has written to her.
There will be no theatricals, the notice has been
posted up on the board this morning. Of course she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
must have got hold of you under false pretences.
Mother says you are to come to us at once. W.
will send down for your things.”</p>

<p>“It’s all very dreadful,” I said. “I feel completely
stunned. Still, I don’t think I ought to leave Mrs.
Hayes-Billington like that.”</p>

<p>“But you must, my dear,” urged Dolly imperatively.
“It is too dreadful for a girl like you to be
associated with such a person. What an impostor she
is! Poor Mrs. Wray is in a state of collapse&mdash;fainting
fits; the doctor has been to see her. The committee
have taken Mrs. Hayes-Billington’s name off the list
in the library and the club, and the sooner she takes
herself out of Silliram the better! Come into the
club with me,” continued Dolly; “I want to fetch
my scarf, and I will walk back with you to ‘The
Dovecot,’ and, if you like, help you to put your
things together?”</p>

<p>I made no reply. I felt as if someone had banged
me upon the head, and I followed Dolly into the club,
feeling extraordinarily dazed and nervous. Fortunately
it was not yet tea-time, and the place was
nearly empty.</p>

<p>As we passed a great black-board, on which notices
were fastened, my companion pointed with her
tennis racket and I read, inscribed in very large
letters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Owing to unforeseen circumstances, the performance
of <i>The Scrap of Paper</i> will not now take
place. L. J. Bowen, Sec. Dramatic Society.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_12">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span>THE NOTORIOUS MRS. DE LACY</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">With</span> considerable difficulty and various feeble
excuses I released myself from Dolly’s assiduities,
promising to send her a chit as soon as I had
collected my thoughts, and to let her know what
I intended to do with respect to this social avalanche.</p>

<p>As I walked back alone to the bungalow I told myself
that it was a strange coincidence that I had been
within the last six months involved in the uprooting
of two homes, “The Roost,” and now “The Dovecot.”
Was there something malignant and destructive
in my personality? That such a scandal should
be placed to the credit of Mrs. Hayes-Billington
seemed a crazy, incredible idea. She was domestic
and prudent, apparently devoted to Bertie, careful
of offending Mrs. Grundy, and totally unlike my
lurid mental picture of a <i>divorcée</i>. Then I suddenly
recalled Colonel Armadale on the <i>Asphodel</i>, and as I
was endeavouring to piece past and present experiences
into one whole, I became aware that a
tonga and a pair of smoking ponies were standing
in front of “The Dovecot,” and beheld Ronnie
hurrying towards me with a white excited face, on
which I could not help noticing a large splash of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
mud! Judging by his appearance he had travelled
far and fast.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ronnie,” I exclaimed, “how glad I am to see
you!” and I flung my arms round his neck and hugged
him. “Why did you not let me know you were
coming?”</p>

<p>“Walk down the road a bit&mdash;walls have ears!
Such an awful business, Eva, and to think of Aunt
Mina letting you in for it&mdash;to think of your being
chaperoned by Mrs. de Lacy! Good Lord!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” I replied, “Dolly Dane has just
told me. The whole station is reeling from the
shock. For my own part I feel as if I were dreaming.”</p>

<p>“Wake up then,” he said sharply, “you must
get out of this at once. I’d a letter from Vesey two
days ago and I have been travelling hard ever since.
It appears that when he was calling here he recognised
Mrs. Hayes-Billington as Mrs. de Lacy, a notorious
<i>divorcée</i>. Four years ago her case was the scandal
of the whole Punjab, and here she is, in another
region, and under another name, doing the respectable
matron and chaperoning <i>my sister</i>. It’s
a pretty awful debut for you, Evie!”</p>

<p>“Somehow I cannot believe it,” I broke in. “I’ve
had such a happy time, and Mrs. Hayes-Billington
has always been so kind to me, so careful of
appearances, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” interrupted my
brother, “a regular bad lot! De Lacy was a political
agent, and she, as Mrs. de Lacy, was celebrated for
her extraordinary good looks and her extravagant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
love affairs. You must get your things packed and
be ready to start with me to-morrow morning at
nine o’clock. I have ordered the same tonga. Just
put a few things together&mdash;your heavy baggage and
the ayah can follow.”</p>

<p>“But to where? Where are you taking me?”</p>

<p>“Why, to Secunderabad, of course. As soon
as I got Vesey’s letter and had pulled myself together,
I dashed over to the colonel’s wife and showed
it to her. She said at once that you must come to
her. Yes, she really is a thundering good sort.
Later on a captain’s quarters, near to the C.O.’s, will
be vacant, and there you and I can set up house.
It will be made a special case, and she has undertaken
to talk over the old man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how delightful, Ronnie!” I exclaimed.
“What a piece of good fortune!”</p>

<p>“Yes, rather,” he assented emphatically. “It
looks as if your presentiment were likely to come off.”</p>

<p>“What am I to say to Mrs. Hayes-Billington?”
I asked after a pause.</p>

<p>“Is she up, and visible?”</p>

<p>“I think so, by this time; I have not seen her all
day, she has had a most dreadful headache.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must have a jaw with her. Yes, I
must. I won’t sneak you out of her house without
an explanation, and I intend to give her a jolly good
bit of my mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ronnie&mdash;<i>must</i> you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I must,” he rejoined, as we entered the
bungalow; “which is the drawing-room?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<p>As I pointed to it in silence he pushed open the
door and entered. Mrs. Hayes-Billington, who was
crouching over the fire, turned on him a ghastly face,
and I realised in a second that she was aware of his
errand. Then like a coward I retreated and went
away to break the news of my impending departure
to the ayah.</p>

<p>“Missie going&mdash;me, too, going to-morrow morning!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>I must confess that I rather expected a scene,
but the ayah accepted the news with staggering
unconcern. Mary was evidently accustomed to these
hasty departures. She was a Deccanee woman, she
informed me, and not sorry to return to her own
country. With astonishing celerity she began to
collect my various and scattered belongings, to sort
and to fold. Natives love the excitement and hurry-scurry
of a hasty move. A native cook welcomes,
rather than otherwise, an unexpected addition to a
dinner; a butler is never more in his element than
when improvising a hasty <i>tamasha</i>, an abruptly
arranged <i>shikar</i> party, or an early morning supper!</p>

<p>Presently Ronnie knocked peremptorily at my
door and said:</p>

<p>“It’s all right. She says of course you must go&mdash;she
is leaving too. Now mind you eat a good
dinner and get to bed early, for it’s a beastly long
journey. Ta ta!”</p>

<p>I did my utmost to do justice to my solitary
meal, though I experienced sensations both varied
and strange. I felt as if I were sitting among ruins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
or as if I had been expelled from school, or was
standing on the edge of a steep precipice gazing
down into the unknown.</p>

<p>After dinner I received yet another little note
from Mrs. Hayes-Billington. “Do come and see
me in my room. D. B.”</p>

<p>In fear and trepidation I accepted the invitation,
but did not, as I anticipated, find my chaperon
in sackcloth and ashes and tears, but as calm as
usual, only deathly pale. She looked a beautiful,
tragic figure, as she stood in the middle of the room,
wrapped in an old pink tea gown. Like myself, I
could see that she was making preparations for an
imminent departure. Before she uttered a word
she walked over and closed the door&mdash;most of our
doors stuck, or rattled&mdash;then she turned about and
faced me.</p>

<p>“Eva, I am most frightfully sorry that this has
happened, more for your sake than mine&mdash;although
to me it means social ruin. You have been a dear
girl, so simple and so loyal; I am really fond of you,
and as I would not like you to think worse of me
than is necessary I have sent for you to tell you my
true story.”</p>

<p>As she concluded, she indicated a chair, into
which I sank in silence, but she still continued to
pace about the room.</p>

<p>“You must know,” she began, “that I was the
daughter of a West Country parson. When I was
eighteen years of age Robert de Lacy, who was
fishing in the neighbourhood, saw me in church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and fell in love with my face on the spot. He soon
contrived to make my father’s acquaintance and
mine. He was fifteen years older than I was, and
had a fine appointment in Northern India. As his
furlough was nearly ended we were married after
a month’s acquaintance. I was not in love with him
but in love with the idea of going to India&mdash;always
the land of my dreams&mdash;also thankful to be released
from a detestable stepmother and a hateful country
groove. India enchanted me; in her I was neither
disappointed nor disillusioned&mdash;but then as the wife
of a wealthy civilian I saw the country from its best
aspect. I had numbers of servants, horses, and
crowds of appreciative friends. We entertained a
good deal. At nineteen I was queen of the station!
My husband, who was exceedingly proud of me,
loaded me with jewels and lovely clothes. At first
I was happy&mdash;my home and children were all in
all to me.”</p>

<p>“Children!” I ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I have two boys; the elder is seventeen.
They were sent to England when they were about
three years old. My husband had certain fixed ideas.
One of them was that no child should remain in
India after that age. Another, that a woman’s
place was with her husband. He did not care about
home life; his work and big game shooting absorbed
all his interests, but it was <i>my</i> duty to remain at
my post as mistress of his house. In the hot weather
he sent me to the hills, or to Cashmere, and himself
went away on shooting trips into Nepaul or Tibet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span></p>

<p>“Except as a sort of ornamental figurehead, I
believe Robert soon grew tired of me. I had not
been well educated; I could sing, and act, and dance,
but none of these accomplishments appealed to <i>him</i>.
He liked a woman who was deeply read, who could
talk politics, statistics, Indian famines, and so on,
and when we were alone, without guests, we would
spend whole days scarcely exchanging a word;
and thus I lived, in a sense, solitary&mdash;my soul
starving. My good looks, which were famous, were
something of a drawback; they made me too conspicuous;
women were afraid of me. On the other
hand, men were my slaves. I had numbers of
admirers, and to fill my idle hours I embarked on
harmless flirtations, merely <i>pour passer les temps</i>&mdash;and
so the years passed. Then up in Cashmere
amid the most romantic and exquisite scenery, I met
my other self&mdash;my twin soul. He was in a cavalry
regiment stationed at Umballa. Well, I need not
dwell on this. You have never seen Cashmere or
Gulmerg, ‘the meadows of roses,’ or the Dal Lake,
by a full moon; or breathed an atmosphere trembling
with an appeal, or looked into the blue eyes of Rupert
Vavasour. After struggling for a whole year I listened
to him, and the end of it was that we went away
together to Japan.” She caught her breath, and
paused for a moment&mdash;standing with her back to me.</p>

<p>I felt myself blushing violently, and was conscious
of a sort of undeserved, shamefaced embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Our elopement was not a nine days’ wonder,”
she resumed, “but a whole season’s talk! Of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
I was divorced. We went to Italy to await the decree
nisi, hoping to marry and be happy ever afterwards.
Rupert had given up the army and we intended to
live abroad until our story was forgotten. But at
Florence he got fever, and, to my indescribable anguish,
died within a week. His people hurried out from
home, ignored me altogether, and wound up his
affairs. Captain Vavasour was immensely wealthy,
but had made no will, and I, neither wife nor widow,
was thrown upon the world, almost destitute. My
own people would not receive me, excepting one old
aunt, who, like myself, was very poor, and I lived
with her until she died. How often and often I wished
that I was dead too! I used to walk about the streets
of London, with nowhere to go, with no one to speak
to, and entirely without friends. I realised then all
the loneliness, misery, and despair of a lost dog! I
had no interest in free museums, picture galleries,
or libraries; my tastes did not tend toward Botticelli
prints or blue Hawthorn china; inanimate objects
bored me to death, but I hungered and starved for
the society to which I had been accustomed, when
one lived and experienced thrills! For years I
breathed an atmosphere of change, excitement, and
luxury; this poverty-stricken, dull isolation was
insupportable. The friends I had known and
entertained in my palmy days passed me by with
blank faces, and people of shady character, who would
have welcomed me with open arms, I avoided like the
black plague. It was a case of Mohammed’s coffin!
Then last summer I made the acquaintance of Bertie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
It all came about through the loan of an umbrella.
I had recovered my looks, and he fell in love with me
and asked me to marry him. Of course I told him
my story, but it made no difference. Bertie is a truly
unselfish man and has been more than good to me.
Then I longed with a sort of aching to see the East
again, and finding that his work was in the south,
where I did not know a soul, and as it was four
years since the divorce, I ventured to return to India,
hoping that I could make a fresh start. I was getting
on, as you know, and beginning to feel so happy and
safe, enjoying the old familiar life and surroundings,
when Mrs. Hancock descended from that former existence
and shattered my house of cards. She beheld
me acting the principal character in a play she had
once seen me appear in in Peshawar&mdash;evidently received
in society, and instantly signed my social death
warrant. Although she sat in the front row, strange
to say I had not noticed her, and I was unaware
of my sentence until I received a note from Mrs.
Dane early this morning. I wired at once to Bertie.
Poor old fellow! I know he will be dreadfully cut
up; he will take me away as soon as possible. Meanwhile,
I shall remain ‘purdah’ until I go down to
the mines, and will never, never again endeavour to
show my face in Indian society.”</p>

<p>All the time she talked she had been walking to
and fro; suddenly she halted before me and said:</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> always said it was a risk bringing you with
us, but Bertie thought otherwise, and then your
aunt was so frantically urgent, the money was such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
a temptation, and you were a nice girl, not at all
modern, and I hoped and prayed that I would never
be found out. I must explain about Colonel Armadale.
No doubt, you, like everyone else, thought I flirted
with him on board that dreadful old tub. He is a
dear old friend and godfather to my elder boy. He
meets Bob and his brother whenever he likes, but I,
although I am their mother, never. He told me
a great deal about them, and that Hugh, the younger,
is brilliantly clever; his father is immensely proud
of him. The child’s only drawback is that he
resembles <i>me</i>! Although I have not seen my boys
I have seen my husband. Not very long before I
came out he and a lady sat directly behind me in
the stalls of a theatre. Another time we met face
to face in the street, looked at one another&mdash;and
passed on.</p>

<p>“Well now, Evie, you will not think too badly
of me, will you&mdash;perhaps, some day, you may forgive
me?”</p>

<p>“I forgive you now,” I said, rising; “indirectly
you have done me a very good turn, for in future
I am to live with Ronnie. I am really sorry that
this has happened to you, and I must tell you that
since I came to Silliram I have enjoyed every day
of the time we have spent here together.”</p>

<p>“And never for a moment suspected that I had
a past?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did think there was something mysterious
about you&mdash;you were so reserved about your affairs.
I thought you had somehow or other come down in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the world, and naturally did not care to talk about
it. You always said you were poor&mdash;but you had
some costly possessions. Your diamonds and your
pearls&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Those pearls are sham!” she interrupted. “I
sold my string for seven hundred pounds, and lived on
it for years. Well, Evie, as you are making an early
start to-morrow morning, I must not detain you any
longer. Will you write to me sometimes?&mdash;‘Care of
Captain Hayes-Billington, the Katchoocan Mines,’
will always find me, and I shall get so few letters.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “I will certainly write.”</p>

<p>“Well then, good-bye, my dear girl. I wish you
all happiness, joy and good fortune.”</p>

<p>As she kissed me I felt her tears upon my face,
and when I had wrenched open the door and blundered
out of the room I was crying too.</p>

<span>A FRESH START</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the nearest railway station to Silliram, our
journey south was both monotonous and dusty.
The country we passed through was disappointingly
flat and uninteresting; a reddish brown plain, broken
here and there by serrated hills of red sandstone,
which at times gave the illusive impression of castles,
battlements and fortresses.</p>

<p>During our long <i>tête-à-tête</i>, Ronnie and I had
found plenty to say to one another on many subjects,
besides lengthy discussions on Aunt Mina’s
delinquencies and Mrs. Hayes-Billington’s past.
With respect to these topics Ronnie was forcibly
eloquent.</p>

<p>“Of course Aunt Mina wanted to get rid of you
at any price, although she wrote me a gushing letter,
saying she had made the most delightful arrangements
for your happiness; but as far as she was really
concerned, you might have gone to the devil!&mdash;and
you <i>did</i> go to the devil in one way when you set up
house with Mrs. Hayes-Billington! The more I
think of it, the more furious I feel. To have been
chaperoned and brought out by such a woman
is enough to blast the name of any girl; and if one
of the Secunderabad cats were to get hold of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
story you would be simply down and out! The
sound thing to do is to pretend you have only just
arrived from England, and drop those weeks in ‘The
Dovecot’ out of your life.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very fine, Ronnie,” I protested,
“but it’s not so easy to drop bits of one’s life like that.
Numbers of people knew me at Silliram. Supposing
some of them were to come down here?”</p>

<p>“Not much fear of that,” he answered emphatically.
“The Silliram crowd seldom travel south&mdash;their
beat is Bombay.”</p>

<p>“After all, Mrs. Hayes-Billington is not such a
coal-black sheep,” I urged. “In many ways she is
a good soul, generous and unselfish, and never says
a nasty thing about anyone. I believe lots of women
have been divorced and are allowed to creep back
into society by degrees.”</p>

<p>“My good girl, don’t talk about what you don’t
understand! Mrs. Hayes-Billington’s case broke
the record. Of course her reputation as a beauty
made her rather conspicuous, her track was strewn
with victims. There is a legend that more than one
silly fool committed suicide on account of her. The
man she went off with was enormously rich&mdash;it was
an absolutely mercenary affair. However, he didn’t
marry her, and left her to prey about the world.
Apparently she picked up with Hayes-Billington, who
by all accounts is a thundering ass!”</p>

<p>“The man Mrs. Hayes-Billington ran away with
could not marry her because he died,” I explained
impressively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, did he? Well, I don’t see that that makes
much difference,” was Ronnie’s amazing reply.
“Although you made such a bad start I expect you
and I will have a real good time housekeeping together,
won’t we, old girl?”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” I replied. “I have learnt a little
about prices and things, and a few words of
Hindustani.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t want Hindustani at Secunderabad.
Most of the natives speak and write English.
My butler was with a married couple before he
came to me; he will help you to run the show,
and will tell you all about the Hali sicca rupee, which
is worth ninety-six dubs&mdash;a dub is like a scrap off
an old copper kettle. We shall fix up No. 30 quarter
in grand style, and have our little dinners and bridge
parties. Mrs. Soames will take you out, and I have
a ripping pony that you can ride. You’d think to
look at her&mdash;I mean Mrs. Soames, not the pony&mdash;that
she was a stiff-necked old maid, as narrow-minded
as they make ’em, but she really is awfully
kind and soft, and does so enjoy being a colonel’s wife
in India, and entertaining the regiment and fussing
over soldiers’ wives. ‘James’ is bound to take to
you. Between ourselves, it’s my opinion that James
would like to flirt a bit in his hours of ease. You
will like Major and Mrs. Mills, our only other
married couple, beside the quartermaster, though
Mrs. Mills is wrapped up in her nursery and housekeeping.”</p>

<p>Before we reached Wadi Junction, I had received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
an outline of what my future friends, amusements
and duties were likely to be, as described in an offhand
sketchy manner by my brother.</p>

<p>As we changed on to the Nizam’s State Railway,
Ronnie met a racing acquaintance, and, with many
apologies, they both retired into a smoking carriage&mdash;there
to discuss important forthcoming events;
meanwhile I made a sort of toilet, arranged my hair
and hat, and dusted my frock, in order to assure a
presentable appearance on arrival.</p>

<p>At Secunderabad station we were met by Mrs.
Soames herself; a slight, smartly-dressed, elderly
woman, with a long thin face and an immense
unnatural looking fringe. She gave me a cordial
welcome, and soon we were trotting up towards
Trimulgherry behind a pair of fast bay cobs. After
the usual journey talk, I said: “It is so very,
very kind of you to take me in&mdash;a sort of waif
and stray.”</p>

<p>“Why of course,” she replied, “I am only too
glad to come to your rescue. Your brother is one of
my favourites, he <i>is</i> such a dear fellow. Although so
popular he is so thoughtful and unspoiled, and
when he brought me Captain Vesey’s letter I saw
at once that there was nothing for it but that he
must go and fetch you here. By and by we shall
settle you into a nice quarter, close to ours, and I
will be your chaperon. No, no, you really must
not thank me so much. I am fond of girls, and I
shall be delighted to have your company. Just one
little word of caution,” extending as she spoke an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
exquisitely gloved hand, “do not mention Mrs.
Hayes-Billington here. If it leaked out that you had
been brought to India and associated with such a
disreputable character, the result might be most
distressing. Although the largest station in India,
Secunderabad is extraordinarily proper and correct.
I have been here for three years and we have not
had <i>one</i> scandal! There is the club,” she broke
off, “our great rendezvous for tennis, dances,
bridge&mdash;and, I think I may call it, the heart of the
station.”</p>

<p>I leant forward, and gazed at an imposing two-storey
building on my left, which stood in a spacious
and well planted compound. Then, bowing to people
on horseback, Mrs. Soames continued:</p>

<p>“You ride of course?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I love it,” I answered promptly, “Mrs.
Hayes-Billington and I hired ponies by the week, and
rode everywhere.”</p>

<p>“My dear girl, <i>please</i> don’t mention that woman’s
name,” she protested in a plaintive voice.</p>

<p>“Well, may I say something, just for once? I
do not think she was really so dreadfully to blame&mdash;her
children were taken away&mdash;she was so much
alone&mdash;I cannot help feeling sorry for her.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying? <i>Sorry</i> for her!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she told me her story the night before I
left; it was not so bad&mdash;but rather sad&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“She threw dust in your eyes of course!” interrupted
my companion, bristling up and speaking
with great asperity. “Those abandoned creatures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
make themselves out to be martyrs of circumstances;
and indeed, my dear, I should not be discussing
such a woman with a girl like you. Now here we
are, and there is James awaiting us.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, we were whirled in between two
gate piers and came to a standstill before a solidly
built bungalow, with a round, bowed sort of veranda.
With hospitable agility, Colonel Soames sprang
down the steps to greet me and handed me out of
the victoria. He was a wiry little man, with keen
granite grey eyes, a small sandy moustache, and a
remarkably square jaw. Judging by his figure and
youthful appearance, he might have been a mere
captain instead of the officer commanding a notable
regiment.</p>

<p>I was conducted into a perfectly appointed
quarter, a C.O.’s bungalow&mdash;light, airy, and furnished
to suit the climate. My room was not large, but
looked most attractive, with its white bed, pink rugs,
and pretty flowered chintz.</p>

<p>“Now make yourself quite at home,” said Mrs.
Soames, “we have a few people dining, but, if
you feel too tired after your journey, as soon as
we go into the drawing-room, you can just slip
away.”</p>

<p>Fortunately my clever ayah Mary had squeezed
quite a goodly amount of raiment into a small
trunk, and I was able to appear in a smart black
evening gown, for which my hopeful aunt had paid
no less a sum than twenty guineas. It seemed to
me that there was a crowd in the drawing-room as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
I entered, but we only mustered twelve, including
Ronnie and myself. I heard Mrs. Soames inform
her guests that I was “just out from home!” Her
tone and glance implied that I had arrived no later
than yesterday, and I was plied with all sorts of
questions by the two men between whom I sat at
the dinner table with respect to the latest books, plays
and news. As I gave rather vague and unsatisfactory
answers, I’m afraid they looked upon me as
a stupid sort of girl, or perhaps ascribed my lame
replies to my strangeness in this new environment,
or the fatigue of a journey from Bombay. So
apparently my six weeks at Silliram were to be as
though they were not, and I was beginning my
career in Secunderabad with a smothered scandal
and a secret!</p>

<p>The dinner party, as a dinner, was a great success.
The cooking, waiting, appointments, and flowers
could not have been bettered at Torrington; these
native servants were certainly more deft and light-footed
than Baker and his subordinates.</p>

<p>I slept soundly in the delightful “Europe”
bed, between lavender scented sheets. This airy
solid bungalow (<i>pucka</i> built) was a delicious change
from the damp and mouldy “Dovecot.” The hours of
the house were early and of military punctuality, and
seven o’clock found me sitting in the veranda, having
<i>chota-hazri</i> with my hostess, who was, as usual, full of
animation and conversation.</p>

<p>As she talked I watched the <i>bheesti</i> and a <i>mali</i>
working in the garden; the former with his great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
<i>mussick</i> filling waterpots and the latter sitting on his
heels, wrapped in a <i>cumblie</i>, digging very deliberately
among tomato plants. My hostess explained to me
that our lines were what is called “in the entrenchment,”
although the officers’ quarters were outside
the fosse and the barracks. These were built back
to back, thus ensuring absolute privacy, and each
had its own large compound. She pointed out the
double-storey mess-house, which faced us across a
maidan, and was dimly seen through clumps of
flaming “gold mohur” and other trees. Not far
to the left of the mess-house lay the jail, which
was castellated, and known by the name of “Windsor
Castle.” Then, taking me by the arm, she led me
to a corner of the veranda and introduced me to
yet another scene. Behind our quarters lay the
Trimulgherry bazaar, overlooked by its celebrated
“Gun Rock.” This was merely a large piece of
granite, shaped precisely like a cannon, and apparently
laid and ready to blow the place to pieces. Presumably
it had been in this position for hundreds
of years.</p>

<p>On his way from parade Ronnie dashed in to
visit me. This was the first time I had seen him in
his uniform. He looked very smart and soldierly and
was riding a perfect darling of a pony, a bright bay
with black points.</p>

<p>“I just dropped in to find out if you were alive
after yesterday,” he said. “You look all right. I
believe Mrs. Soames is taking you to call on the
ladies of the regiment this morning. Only Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Mills, the major’s wife, and the quartermaster’s old
woman; afterwards, she is sure to bring you down
to the club and show you who’s who. I am playing
polo up at Bolarum, but keep your pecker up&mdash;I’ll
see you again before dinner,” and he wheeled about
his pony, and was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_14">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span>THE CLUB</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">The</span> station club, “the very heart of the community,”
as described by Mrs. Soames, lay about two miles
from our lines. As we drove down there behind our
spanking Australian cabs, my chaperon, who was
a great talker, enlarged upon the subject.</p>

<p>“Our club,” she remarked, “is capitally situated
just half way between the cantonments and Hyderabad
city, close to the parade ground, shops and
cemetery, with roads diverging in every direction;
a modern but not very dignified building, as you
see. Its businesslike outline and platform verandas
have led scoffers to compare it to a railway station,
and hint that it is the work of a railway
engineer, who desired to raise a monument to the
glory of his line! In this idea there may be a touch
of professional jealousy; anyway, ‘handsome is that
handsome does.’ The club is supplied with the
latest improvements in the matter of ventilation and
comfort. No London club has better billiard tables,
more luxurious armchairs, or a superior cook. We
women are not suffered to set foot in it, except on
special occasions, such as receptions and balls;
mankind are a greedy, selfish pack, who keep the
best of everything for themselves! Well, here we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
are!” as we turned abruptly into a large enclosure.
“It’s rather early,” she continued, “I see the bullock
bandy with the band has only just arrived, so we may
as well sit in the carriage for a little longer and I
will point you out the chief objects of interest.”</p>

<p>“Yes, please do,” I said, “everything, as you may
suppose, is new to me. What is the small building
where I see so many ladies on the veranda?”</p>

<p>“That, my dear, is the ‘morghi-khana,’ or hen
house; a humble offshoot of the larger establishment,
where the ladies of the station forgather to
read papers, exchange news and play bridge, for, as
I have already told you, we are sternly debarred
from the parent premises&mdash;so amusing!”</p>

<p>“And what,” I inquired, “is the round raised
platform with the tea table and chairs? It looks like
a large white cake.”</p>

<p>“It is called a ‘chabutra,’ and was originally intended
for a bandstand&mdash;you see one in every station.
People make use of them for tea and talk; they are
raised a foot or two off the ground, and keep you
nicely out of the way of snakes. Thank goodness we
don’t have many in Secunderabad&mdash;the dry climate
doesn’t suit them.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Soames imparted information, I had been
using my eyes and absorbing my new surroundings.
In comparison with the club at Silliram, this was as a
city to a village! Dozens of men and women passed
to and fro, some making for the club, some for the
<i>morghi-khana</i>. Many of the men were in polo kit
or flannels; the women as a rule were remarkably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
smart, their frocks and hats were undoubtedly
imported, and had no connection with the <i>dirzee</i> or
bazaar. There were numbers of motor cars as well
as carriages in the compound, and the road beyond
was thronged with vehicles continually passing up
and down.</p>

<p>“Did you notice the three ladies who have just
settled themselves at the tea-table?” said Mrs.
Soames. “They are always early birds, and are no
doubt waiting for bridge or friends. Shall I tell
you about them, as you will meet them every day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do, if you please,” I replied, as I glanced
over at the trio. Mrs. Soames gave a little preliminary
cough, and began:</p>

<p>“The elderly woman, in the creased tussore costume
and toque three sizes too large, is Mrs. Lakin. She
is not nearly so old as she looks, but the struggle on
small means, separation from her children, unhealthy
stations, and the burden and heat of the East, have
aged her. She comes of a good old Indian family,
and was born in the country. At last she has emerged
from her early difficulties; her daughters are married,
and her husband commands a regiment. Mrs.
Lakin is one of the old type of mem-sahibs, now almost
extinct, who speak the language fluently, and know
the bazaar prices to a dub. Her servants have
grown grey in her service, her animals are fat and
well liking; she is the soul of hospitality, and the
most unselfish and sincere of women&mdash;her one weakness
is auction bridge,” and Mrs. Soames concluded
this little sketch with a complacent smirk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span></p>

<p>“So much for Mrs. Lakin,” I said, “and now for
the smart lady with a white aigrette in her hat.”</p>

<p>“That is Mrs. Belmont, a typical modern mem-sahib.
Her husband is in the Tea-Green Hussars.
She had a huge fortune&mdash;made, it is said, in glue&mdash;and
affects to loathe India, which she scorns as a
paradise of the middle-classes&mdash;her own <i>milieu</i> as it
happens! Unlike Mrs. Lakin she does not know
her retinue by sight. To her, one black man is
precisely the same as another. Her housekeeping
is in the hands of a magnificent butler, who is amassing
a fortune; her personal attendant, a Europe maid&mdash;<i>such</i>
a mistake out here&mdash;is amassing admirers, and
enjoying the time of her life. Mrs. Belmont is a
good many years older than her husband, but wonderfully
well preserved, and, considering her class, really
quite presentable.”</p>

<p>Here I recognised the inflexible attitude of a
county lady towards the heiress of thousands made
in glue.</p>

<p>“The third on the chabutra is Mrs. Potter,”
continued my companion. “If you listen you can
hear her voice, and her loud rollicking laugh. She
is also known as the ‘Daily She Mail,’ and ‘Slater’s,’
as she is an inveterate, I may say, official newsmonger.
Be sure that you are <i>very</i> careful what you
say to her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t see how <i>I</i> can give her much
news.”</p>

<p>“My dear, you personify news! She will pick
your brain in ten minutes; she will know all about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
your family, your fortune, your tastes, and possibly
the price of your hat! It is marvellous how she gets
hold of the first tidings of such events as the movements
of troops, engagements, quarrels or scandals;
and the worst of it is, that in many cases her information
is correct. Some say she has a friend at the
Post Office; others, that she owes much to her ayah’s
circle at the bazaar, or that Joe Potter, her husband,
has his ear to the ground in the city&mdash;where he is
a vague ‘something.’ They live in a fine bungalow
in Secunderabad, but have no claim to any social
standing. All the same, Mrs. Potter goes everywhere;
her card is filled the moment she appears at a
dance, she is never ‘left out’ of any entertainment,
and people propitiate her with craven attentions.
It is much safer to be her friend than her enemy, for
she uses her pen as well as her tongue, and supplies
sharp unsigned articles to the press. Well, now I
have given you an outline of one or two personalities.
Here comes Mrs. Wolfe, that handsome dark woman
in the yellow car. She is the wife of an official at
Chudderghat, and that is a stranger with her. Let us
get out now, and hurry over to the chabutra, or we
won’t get good seats.”</p>

<p>We ascended the steps of the white cake without
any undignified haste, and Mrs. Soames formally presented
me to Mesdames Lakin, Belmont and Potter, as
“My friend Miss Lingard.” We all bowed and
smiled at one another, and fresh tea was ordered
from a bearded butler.</p>

<p>As my chaperon was exchanging civilities with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
the ladies already established, Mrs. Wolfe and her
companion joined us. Mrs. Wolfe was a tall elegant
woman, with magnificent black eyes and an intensely
animated expression.</p>

<p>“This,” she announced, with a comprehensive
wave of her hand, “is my cousin Miss Payne. Sally
Payne, who, after her arduous labours in globe-trotting,
has come to enjoy a domestic holiday with
me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmont raised her glasses and considered
the new-comer with an air of grave appraisement. A
little woman with reddish hair, sharp features and
a pale clever face; she wore a well-cut white linen,
a Panama hat, and carried in a white gloved hand a
gold-handled sunshade.</p>

<p>Miss Payne bowed all round with self-possessed
grace, seated herself, and began to take off her
gloves.</p>

<p>“Just arrived?” said Mrs. Potter brusquely.</p>

<p>“Yes, only yesterday morning.”</p>

<p>Then she glanced at me and said, “We came
up from Wadi in the same train. You were the
girl in that delightful blue silk dust cloak; it made
me <i>so</i> envious. When you tire of it, please let me
have the first offer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly,” I answered, in the same key,
“but I do not propose to part with it yet.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Potter’s swift glance gave me to understand
she would deal with me presently, but that just now
she was particularly interested in Miss Payne, and
she once more addressed her:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span></p>

<p>“Did I not see you at the Cinderella?” she
inquired in her judicial voice.</p>

<p>“Guilty!” admitted the stranger. “My cousin
dragged me there, but I enjoyed it immensely.
What ‘go’ there was about it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a good dance,” agreed Mrs. Potter,
“though one of the band had a fit, and the ice-cream
ran short; but on the whole, everything was
thoroughly well done.”</p>

<p>“And what heaps of dancing men and pretty
women!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we were just about to discuss the
beauties of the evening&mdash;‘present company always
included!’” and Mrs. Potter glanced at Mrs.
Belmont with her beautiful complexion, and then
at Mrs. Wolfe with her animated, vivid face.</p>

<p>“Oh, pray don’t mind <i>me</i>,” protested Miss Payne,
coolly accepting the implied compliment. “At
forty I am past the beauty stage. Last night a
worried-looking man rushed up to me and asked
where he could find my daughter? Imagine such
a question for a respectable English spinster!”</p>

<p>“I expect he took you for Mrs. Hastings,”
suggested Mrs. Soames, “her hair is the same shade.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll make it my business to look out for
Mrs. Hastings, and see myself as others see me. I
must confess, if I had been endowed with a daughter,
I’d have chosen that delightful vision in rose-coloured
chiffon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Warren!” said Mrs. Potter with a
sniff. “As it happens, she has no mother. Yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
she looked well enough, but her dress&mdash;an old one
dyed&mdash;was too remarkable, especially as she danced
with the same partner most of the evening!”</p>

<p>“Where was her chaperon?” inquired Miss
Payne, as she helped herself to two lumps of sugar.</p>

<p>“Probably she had none,” was the startling reply.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Miss Payne, brandishing the
empty sugar tongs. “I know that chaperons are
extinct at home&mdash;the bicycle killed them&mdash;but I’d
no idea that India was so emancipated.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we are,” replied Mrs. Potter. “I
heard some violent kissing last evening behind the
screen where my partner and I were sitting out, and
I happened to see the couple later&mdash;a girl and a
married man!”</p>

<p>“Oh, really!” protested Miss Payne with mock
horror, “I shall be obliged to retire. I am <i>much</i> too
young for this kind of conversation!”</p>

<p>Then she looked across at me and burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> say?”</p>

<p>This question drew upon me the immediate notice
of Mrs. Potter. Hitherto I had been sitting a little
in the background, now she turned round and favoured
me with special attention.</p>

<p>“And you arrived yesterday, did you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I acknowledged with meek humility.</p>

<p>She stared at me so hard that I felt quite out of
countenance, and could not find anything else to say.</p>

<p>“You are Captain Lingard’s sister, I believe?
How nice it is for him to have you out here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span></p>

<p>“And very nice for me&mdash;to be with him,” I murmured.</p>

<p>“Your first visit, of course?” she was proceeding,
when my chaperon interposed, and, moving a little
nearer, asked Mrs. Potter a question about an
imminent bridge tournament, and I was for the
moment released. I confess I rather envied the independence
of Miss Payne, who, having finished tea,
had courageously betaken herself to the library.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lakin, hitherto engaged in cutting up
cake and waiting on the company, now took a seat
beside me and proceeded to break the ice. I noticed
that her complexion was a pale biscuit colour, and her
blue eyes looked faded, but she had a sweet expression&mdash;perhaps
once upon a time she had been
pretty.</p>

<p>“So I hear you are a new-comer. I wonder what
you will think of India.”</p>

<p>“So far, I like it immensely,” I answered.</p>

<p>“There have been wonderful changes since I set
foot in the country. That was thirty years ago.
Then this club was a small affair, and stood farther
down where the shop is now. Everything is made
so comfortable in these days. People rush backwards
and forwards to England for a few weeks’
holiday. Formerly it was a wonderful thing if you
got home once in five or six years. All the same, I
liked those times best.”</p>

<p>“Did you!” I exclaimed. “But why?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not altogether because everything was
quarter the price, though of course that does make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
a difference, especially when you have a large family.
Things were quieter and easier. Generals did not
come hustling round when they were least expected,
and you and your friends were left in a station for
three or four years instead of being whipped off
as now at a moment’s notice. The servants were a
superior class, and one grew attached to them, and
almost every girl that came to India was bound to
find a husband.”</p>

<p>“And that is all changed, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, it’s as difficult to get off a girl here as
it is elsewhere. In these days when the exchange is
so low, sending home money is ruination&mdash;people
bring out their families, and the country is overrun
with paying guests, and this, in India, so famous once
for hospitality! My two girls are married&mdash;not
grand matches, but to really good fellows&mdash;and I
must confess I miss them. My husband and I are
alone&mdash;just Darby and Joan. I am sorry to say
that his time will soon be up, he will be retired, and
we go home for good next spring.”</p>

<p>“Then you love India?” I said.</p>

<p>She nodded expressively, and added:</p>

<p>“You see I was born out here, as were my father
and mother before me. We come of families who have
made their home in India for many generations&mdash;educated
of course in England, they all return like
homing pigeons to the Army, to the Civil Service,
and to many other posts. India draws them&mdash;they
<i>all</i> hear the East a-calling.”</p>

<p>“And so you will be really sorry to retire?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she admitted, “and if we can’t stand it
we will return and settle down in the hills. I
can see us in England, probably established in some
London suburb, in a little house, with smoky chimneys,
the boiler always out of order, two servants&mdash;saying
they’ve too much to do&mdash;ourselves with nothing to
do, no interests, and none of our accustomed comforts.
My! I don’t like to think of it! I have
heard such tales from friends who have gone back
to England, and find the change awful, especially the
climate.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I exclaimed astonished, “you do surprise
me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered. “Give me the ordinary
honest hot weather out here. You know where you
are; when the heat or rains are due, and when they
cease. It is so much better than your capricious
sun one day and snow the next, and your desperate
English winters. Most English die in winter, and
no wonder! You are staying with Mrs. Soames,”
she continued. “Your brother is in Colonel Soames’s
regiment; they are going home in the spring like
ourselves.”</p>

<p>This announcement gave me a shock. I understood
that there might be a move from Secunderabad,
but I never realised that it would be to England,
or that I might find myself back at Torrington,
before the year was out. As I pondered the subject
Mrs. Lakin suddenly rose, in answer to a frantic
signal from another matron.</p>

<p>“Bridge,” she said, turning to me with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
triumphant smile, “they have got up a rubber
at last!”</p>

<p>Then she descended somewhat heavily, and hurried
away to the <i>morghi-khana</i>.</p>

<p>“A good soul, but oh, what clothes!” said Mrs.
Potter, looking after the retreating figure. “It is
whispered that they are chosen by an envious old
maid sister-in-law. I can see a world of spite in
that short-waisted gown and the pantomime toque;
and yet the poor lady is pleased, and tells us that
<i>now</i> she gets everything from home.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the clothes,” put in Mrs. Wolfe,
“when the woman inside them is a jewel. She is a
sort of godmother to half the station.”</p>

<p>Seeing that I had been abandoned by Mrs. Lakin,
Mrs. Potter again turned to talk to me.</p>

<p>“As you have only just arrived, you have seen
nothing of India so far except railway stations?”</p>

<p>I coloured with guilt, and nodded a deceitful
assent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Potter’s quick black eyes looked me up and
down, and then she remarked:</p>

<p>“I dare say you will have a very good time. This
is a most interesting place, if you care for that sort of
thing; and you can see something of all conditions of
men, Asiatic and European. There is, as you know,
the great city of Hyderabad, which we may not enter
without a pass. Then comes Chudderghat, where
the Politicals and the Resident live; he has the
finest Residency in India. There are also colleges
and the convent of the Holy Rosary. Next we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
have Secunderabad itself, all shops, and bazaars,
and fine old bungalows. That brings us here. Up
your way the Army is sprinkled about&mdash;artillery and
engineers, cavalry and line; this is the largest
garrison in India&mdash;and now you have the place in
a nutshell!”</p>

<p>“Who are these people?” I inquired, as I
observed close to the <i>chabutra</i> several handsome
dark young men getting out of a large motor.</p>

<p>“Oh, they are some of the Nizam’s entourage,
mostly noblemen and officers of the Golconda Lancers.
They have been playing polo with the Lighthearts’
team. Your brother is their captain. Of course,
you must feel rather strange at first, not knowing
a soul in the place!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered. I could not say why, but I
found it difficult to talk to Mrs. Potter; her sharp
eyes seemed to stab me like knives.</p>

<p>“But you will soon know everybody,” she continued,
with a little air of patronage. “Out here we
are all supposed to be in the same set. The set in
Secunderabad is embodied by the club&mdash;to be a
member is our social hall-mark. All the rest are,
so to speak, in outer darkness&mdash;where I believe
there’s a good deal of gnashing of teeth!”</p>

<p>As she was speaking I happened to glance towards
the entrance through which people were still coming
and going, and there I beheld someone who was not
a stranger. It was Captain Falkland, attended by
Kipper.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_15">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span>A RENEWED FRIENDSHIP</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Captain Falkland</span> presented a striking appearance
in his A.D.C. uniform, mounted on a fine black horse.
He looked thoroughly at home in the saddle.</p>

<p>“Behold that faithless man!” cried Mrs. Wolfe
excitedly; “how <i>am</i> I to get hold of him?”</p>

<p>“I suppose the general has been inspecting something,
as he is on duty,” said Mrs. Potter, “and there
is the dog that is always at his heels.”</p>

<p>“Lord Runnymede’s only son is dead,” observed
a lady, who was now one of the company on “the
cake.” “He was always a poor consumptive
creature, and Captain Falkland is the next heir.
What a chance for some girl!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s not a marrying man,” declared Mrs.
Wolfe with brisk decision; “he bars girls, and
naturally he would never think of one of our ‘spins’
out here.”</p>

<p>In answer to an agitated signal with a newspaper,
Captain Falkland approached. He was now on foot.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve been trying to catch your eye for
ages,” screamed Mrs. Wolfe. “You never answered
my chit, and you know you half promised to take
me on the lake to-morrow. Do; come and have
tiffin first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<p>He shook his head, and, before he had time to
speak, she hastily added:</p>

<p>“Oh then, I’ll meet you at the boathouse! I
don’t intend to let you off. An hour’s rowing on the
Hussain Saugur will be <i>so</i> good for you!”</p>

<p>Just at this moment Captain Falkland’s eye
caught mine, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Miss Lingard! Well, I am astonished. When
did you come out?”</p>

<p>I was prevented from answering by Kipper, who
had also recognised me, and sprang into my lap in a
state of hysterical delight, ruining my nice clean
white linen with the red dust off his paws.</p>

<p>“So you and Miss Lingard have already met?”
said Mrs. Soames, and I noticed that Mrs. Wolfe
honoured me with a piercing stare.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, we knew one another at home,” he
replied, and then this bold man stepped up and
took a chair on “the cake”&mdash;the one just vacated
by Mrs. Lakin.</p>

<p>“When did you arrive?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Only the other day,” rejoined Mrs. Soames,
evidently afraid that I would give myself away,
and I sat by in helpless acquiescence. “Miss Lingard
is staying with me.”</p>

<p>“Kip is awfully pleased to see you,” he said,
addressing me particularly.</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it nice of him?&mdash;and it is more than
six months since we parted. He was once my
property,” I added, looking over at my chaperon.</p>

<p>After this evidently unexpected announcement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
there was a significant pause, and some of the ladies
exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“How did you leave them at Torrington?”
inquired my neighbour.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, thank you. They all came to see
me off from London.”</p>

<p>“What steamer did you come out in?” demanded
Mrs. Potter, but I pretended not to hear, and
said:</p>

<p>“Dora is married, as I dare say you know, and
Bev has decided to go into the Diplomatic Service.”</p>

<p>“Sorry for the Service,” muttered Captain Falkland.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you came out in the <i>Modena</i>?”
persisted Mrs. Potter, who I could see was boiling over
with questions, but Mrs. Soames, an efficient general,
now rose and said:</p>

<p>“I promised to look for a book for Jimmy, and
I had nearly forgotten it&mdash;something to do with
military law&mdash;arrived in the last batch. Come along,
Miss Lingard, and I will show you the library.”</p>

<p>Captain Falkland rose to attend upon us, but
was instantly arrested by Mrs. Wolfe, who figuratively
flung herself upon him. She was one of those women
who triumphantly capture the attention of men&mdash;be
they never so wary&mdash;and thrust the rest of her sex
ruthlessly aside. We left her holding her prey by
the sheer force of her volubility, and talking with
surpassing gesticulation and animation; but presently
with surprising adroitness he managed to escape and
joined us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>

<p>“So you and Miss Lingard were acquainted in
England?” said my chaperon.</p>

<p>“Oh, rather&mdash;we are connections. My people
and Miss Lingard’s have lived within a few miles of
one another for centuries. The Falklands and the
Lingards are old and trusted friends.”</p>

<p>“How amusing! I had no idea of this,” said
Mrs. Soames; nor had the poor deceived lady any
idea that the speaker and I had only spoken to one
another on two occasions!</p>

<p>“You must come and dine with us,” she continued
hospitably, “just a quiet little family dinner.”</p>

<p>As they were arranging the day and hour, I stood
aloof talking to Kip, and was astonished to behold
yet another familiar face and form. Could I believe
my eyes? There was Mr. Balthasar descending
from an imposing grey motor.</p>

<p>He crossed the compound quickly and accosted
Ronnie, who had just ridden in from polo; they
talked eagerly together as the latter dismounted and
his pony was led away. I noticed that Ronnie took
Mr. Balthasar familiarly by the arm and spoke to
him earnestly for some minutes, whilst from time to
time Balthasar nodded his close-shaven bullet head
in emphatic agreement. Undoubtedly Balthasar had
heard of my arrival, had possibly seen me and informed
Ronnie of our former meeting, and Ronnie
had pledged him to silence. Now, including Captain
Vesey, there were four people who held the secret
of my past.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Soames and I moved towards our victoria,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
escorted by Captain Falkland, Ronnie took a few steps
towards us, but his companion stood stock-still, and
looked at me as blankly as if he had never seen me
before. Then one of his thick black lashes quivered
slightly. Yes, it was an unmistakable wink!</p>

<p>As our carriage wheeled about to thread its way
among a crowd of other vehicles I beheld Mrs.
Wolfe “descend upon the fold.” She seized the
helpless A.D.C. and carried him off in triumph to the
<i>morghi-khana</i>.</p>

<p>The next afternoon Mrs. Soames and I drove up to
the polo ground to witness a match, in which Ronnie
greatly distinguished himself. He was captain of the
regimental team, rode splendidly, and was remarkably
well mounted. I could see that he was an important
factor in the local polo world. I noticed Mrs. Lakin
in a dreadful old phaeton, drawn by a bony chestnut
horse. As she caught sight of us she waved her hand
with effusion.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she a funny old thing?” said Mrs. Soames.
“She lives down at Begumpett, where her husband
commands a regiment, and she dresses like a caretaker,
but is such a good, generous woman, so kind to
the natives, Eurasians, and poor whites. She spends
on others&mdash;saves on herself. To my certain knowledge
she has had that toque ever since I came to
the station. If anyone is ill, it’s Mrs. Lakin to the
front; if anyone is in trouble, they turn to Mrs.
Lakin. Her husband is a smart, well-set-up man,
and looks years younger than his dowdy wife.
Their bungalow is on the style of forty years ago,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
quite a curiosity. They have queer old furniture
and Argand lamps, but give capital dinners in the
good solid style; everything in the most lavish
profusion. Masses of servants, dozens of courses,
wonderful curries, and such tender mutton! She
is the secretary of our Mutton Club. It is really an
historical object lesson to dine with the Lakins, and
to learn how things were done&mdash;say at the time of
the battle of Plassey.”</p>

<p>“I wish she would invite me to dinner,” I replied.
“She is a nice, confidential, motherly old thing,
adores India, and cannot endure the idea of leaving
the country.”</p>

<p>“No, I dare say not,” said Mrs. Soames; “all her
children were born and most of her relations are
buried out here. Her sons and daughters are scattered
about this Presidency. I don’t suppose she has anyone
belonging to her at home, and would be rather
at a loose end in Bayswater or West Kensington.”</p>

<p>“She might write her memoirs,” I suggested,
and here Ronnie and several of his friends surrounded
our carriage and claimed our attention.</p>

<p>The night that Captain Falkland dined with the
Soameses the only other guests were Major and Mrs.
Mills, the chaplain and his wife, and ourselves&mdash;a somewhat
sober party. I must confess that I took unusual
pains with my appearance. My ayah and luggage
had arrived. Captain Falkland had never seen me
in full war paint, that is to say in evening dress,
for at what he called the “beanfeast” I had worn
a demi-toilette. I think Mrs. Soames was a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
impressed by the fact of our former acquaintance;
at any rate, she sent us in to dinner together, and
we talked away gaily.</p>

<p>We discoursed about Torrington and Beke, the
“Beetle,” and also the “Plough and Harrow.”</p>

<p>“That was a ghostly old place,” he remarked.
“I spent two nights there and heard the most extraordinary
noises, as if someone was ploughing up
and down the passages.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how amusing!” exclaimed Mrs. Soames.</p>

<p>“Surely you don’t believe in ghosts?” I said.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not sure that I do,” he replied, “although
we own one ourselves&mdash;appearance guaranteed only
to members of the family&mdash;but I have a sort
of sneaking belief in those horrible things called
‘Elementals.’”</p>

<p>“An Elemental&mdash;what is that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, a sort of half ghost, half reptile, a hideous
animal&mdash;or even a too frightful vegetable! Germans
call them ‘House devils.’ They are the most modern
and fashionable article, and have entirely cut out
the old sheeted spectre and clanking chains business.”</p>

<p>“And what do they <i>do</i>?”</p>

<p>“All manner of hateful tricks; for instance,
supposing you’ve laid down a book or an umbrella
for a moment, you turn about, and it’s gone! After
a protracted search and considerable loss of time and
temper, behold it once more before your eyes! Say
you have discovered something important in a newspaper
and particularly wish to show it to a friend,
you may hunt the paper through and through until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
you’re nearly crazy, and there’s not a sign of it.
That’s the work of an Elemental. When you have
written, with painful labour, a most particular letter
and tip over the ink&mdash;Elemental again! Or when
you are late and in a terrific hurry, and your only
collar stud jumps out of your hand, rolls away and
falls into a hole in the floor, you tear your hair,
and delight the Elemental! Some go so far as to say
that bruises and pinches for which we cannot account
come from the same quarter.”</p>

<p>“Horrible!” I said. “I’d a thousand times sooner
have to deal with a banshee.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” he replied, “they only sit outside
the window and howl and wail; but they will never
wail for <i>you</i>, as you are not Irish.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “I rather wish I were.”</p>

<p>“Do you, my dear girl?” said Mrs. Soames.
“How very amusing!”</p>

<p>“They are an attractive nation, a most happy-go-lucky
lot,” resumed my partner. “I sometimes go
over there to hunt with a friend. The very last
time I crossed I told the porter to label my luggage
for Bristol. Luckily, I caught him just in time as
he was pasting on ‘London.’ I asked him what
the dickens he meant? ‘Shure, yer honour,’ he
replied quite calmly, ‘I’m bound to put <i>something</i>
on&mdash;and these is the only ones I have!’ He seemed
to think he was doing his duty, and looked so genial
and so pleased with me that I believe I gave him
sixpence.”</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful how <i>you</i> get Captain Falkland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
to talk,” said Mrs. Mills when we forgathered in the
drawing-room; “with me he is generally as dumb
as a fish.”</p>

<p>“He is an example of a man who makes a little
conversation go a long way,” said Mrs. Soames.
“Rather a drawback for an aide-de-camp. However,
what he does say is generally to the point, and he has
the most beautiful manners. He must have learnt
them from his mother Lady Louisa&mdash;she belongs
to the old school, and is as proud as Lucifer! I
don’t envy the unfortunate girl who will be her
daughter-in-law. I do not think that in her eyes
anyone short of a princess will be a fitting match for
her dear Brian; however, he is a nice fellow, and
one of those rare, unselfish individuals who enjoy
listening to other people.”</p>

<p>“Then I should imagine he has a thoroughly happy
time with Mrs. Wolfe,” said the major’s wife. “She
must nearly talk his head off, and with her great
black eyes, enormous mouth and flashing teeth, she
sometimes looks as if she were going to <i>eat</i> him!”</p>

<p>It was painfully evident that this lady was no
favourite with Mrs. Mills.</p>

<p>“Oh, she just talks as easily as she breathes,”
declared Mrs. Soames good-naturedly. “It’s her
second nature. She is a brilliantly clever woman, and
<i>so</i> amusing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I much prefer her cousin Miss Payne,”
declared Mrs. Mills; “she is really unique; so
original, independent, and interested in the whole
world. Mrs. Wolfe is merely interested in herself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
her admirer for the time being; she cannot exist
without some attaché. Whether he likes it or not
she has a way of annexing a man that there is no
resisting. Her tactics are excessively bold and open.
If she takes a fancy to any particular individual his
struggles are useless; he is condemned to dance, to
ride, to boat, and to play tennis with her, until she
is tired of his society.”</p>

<p>“But it’s all so absolutely harmless,” protested
Mrs. Soames. “Mabel Wolfe is an excellent wife;
her three children are at home, and I suppose she
thinks, being young and gay, that she is entitled to
some distraction!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you call ‘entitled,’” rejoined
Mrs. Mills, “but I know for a fact that she was
at the bottom of the breaking off of the Wallington-Allan
engagement, and there was ‘distraction’ if
you like! I grant you that she has a wonderfully
animated manner. Her descriptions are vivid, her
‘take offs’ are inimitable. She entertains the men,
and they like her, but, for my part, for a woman with
three little children&mdash;&mdash;” She paused abruptly as the
lords of creation were now sauntering in, and the
subject of Mrs. Wolfe and her shortcomings was
postponed to another occasion.</p>

<p>After some desultory conversation, Mrs. Soames
uttered the words “A little music,” and I was conducted
to the piano&mdash;a rich-toned Schiedmayer&mdash;and
Colonel Soames begged me to sing something he
had heard me trying over that morning.</p>

<p>After one song I was urged to many. My efforts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
were unexpectedly appreciated. Captain Falkland
was evidently fond of music; he stood by the piano
turning over the leaves, and begging for his special
favourites, and I was retained at the instrument
until it was ten o’clock, the hour for the departure
of our guests&mdash;all early birds.</p>

<p>“Are you riding in the mornings, Mrs. Soames?”
inquired Captain Falkland, as he was about to take
leave.</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure I am,” she replied briskly.</p>

<p>“Well then, if I may, I will call in on Thursday
and take my chance. We might have a gallop round
Moul Ali racecourse.”</p>

<p>On Thursday, which was the garrison holiday, a
large riding party assembled outside our quarters.
Colonel and Mrs. Soames, Major and Mrs. Mills, Ronnie
and his greatest friend in the regiment, Mr. Arkwright,
Captain Gloag, the adjutant, Captain Falkland, Colonel
Grey (a colonel of the artillery in Trimulgherry&mdash;not
very far from our lines), his two daughters and myself.</p>

<p>The Misses Grey, Emily and Mabel, were not remarkably
pretty, but were very popular in the station.
Their mother being dead, their father enacted the
part of an effective chaperon. He was a wonderfully
dapper, active little widower, and looked young to
be the father of these well-grown young women, was
a capital tennis player and an indefatigable dancer.
It was certainly rather hard upon the girls that he
laid such heavy toll upon them for partnership on
tennis court or in ballroom. At every dance it was
an unwritten law that each had to reserve three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
dances for her parent. As they danced beautifully
their young men friends considered this claim an
outrageous exercise of parental authority. Certainly
the little colonel danced amazingly well. If by any
chance one of the girls “cut” her father’s waltz,
domestic matters would be more or less disagreeable
for some time. In all other respects he was a pattern
to chaperons.</p>

<p>Moul Ali, an otherwise forsaken racecourse, was
often the scene of morning and evening gallops, and
the forlorn, dilapidated stand made a suitable resort
for <i>chotah hazri</i>, afternoon teas, or even moonlight
suppers. The course and stand were the sole attraction
to people from the cantonments, as this portion
of the Deccan is surprisingly ugly, and has to depend
for its beauty on sunset and moonlight effects. The
land is barren, covered with low-growing shrub and
enormous red sandstone boulders of every size and
shape. So numerous are these that there is a native
legend to the effect that when the Creator had completed
His work, He discharged all the rubbish in
this part of the world. For miles and miles it is a
sea of stones, with not even a palm or a mango tope
to break the monotony.</p>

<p>On this particular Thursday morning the sun was
scarcely over the horizon when we moved off <i>en masse</i>.
I rode with Colonel Soames. Our way lay along a
rough cart track, full of ruts and rocks, bordered with
bleached jungle grass and thorny, leafless bushes.
At last we arrived at our destination and there let
ourselves and our horses “out.” How I enjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
that delightful gallop with the fresh morning air
beating in my face! Captain Falkland’s great waler
and my stud-bred raced along together side by side,
and we were soon far ahead of the rest of the party.</p>

<p>“Your animal has a turn of speed; that was
a good stretcher,” he remarked, as we subsided to a
walk. “You love riding, I can see.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied; “and here it is all so nice and
free. One is, as it were, off the road,” and I waved
my hand at the enormous stretch of open country.</p>

<p>“That’s so,”he assented. “There are no farmers
to head you off new wheat, but it’s pretty bad
going. You have not yet come across any of our big
nullahs.” Then turning round, so as almost to look
me straight in the face, “I say, do tell me, now we
are by ourselves, how you happened to come out
to India.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to come,” I replied. “I have always
longed to see the East.”</p>

<p>“That you particularly wanted anything would
be no reason for your getting it, if I know Mrs.
Lingard. Rather the other way I should say; so tell
me the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Well then,the real reason&mdash;&mdash;” Here I came to
a full stop.</p>

<p>“Yes, go on please&mdash;the <i>real</i> reason.”</p>

<p>“Was Beverley,” I brought out with an effort.
“He was so horribly fond of me.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” exclaimed my companion. “What
a way to put it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span></p>

<p>“And although I couldn’t endure him, and snubbed
him fiercely on every occasion, still my aunt was
afraid&mdash;&mdash;” And again I hesitated.</p>

<p>“That you might be tempted? Yes, I see.”</p>

<p>“There were no grounds for her fears I do assure
you, but when Aunt Mina saw a chance of shipping
me to India, naturally she seized upon it&mdash;and of
course I was only too glad to come.”</p>

<p>“Did she ship you to your brother?” inquired
my companion.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;no&mdash;not exactly,” I stammered.</p>

<p>“Oh, then, there <i>is</i> something behind!”</p>

<p>“There is,” I admitted.</p>

<p>“Nothing much, I’ll bet my boots. You haven’t
it in you to keep a deadly secret.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” I replied. “For all you know
to the contrary, I may deserve the kettle. I heard
you talking to Mrs. Potter about truth.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hope I didn’t put my foot in it?
Truth, between you and me and the doorstep,
is not her <i>most</i> prominent virtue. Now, you have
it written all over your face; you couldn’t tell a lie if
you tried.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t hurl these compliments at me,”
I protested, “especially as I don’t deserve them. I
may not tell a lie&mdash;but I might <i>act</i> one!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he demanded, reining up
suddenly; and Kip, who had caught us up at last, sat
down to pant.</p>

<p>“I do not see why I should explain. You seem to
expect me to tell you everything about myself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
my affairs as a matter of course. On your side, you
divulge nothing.”</p>

<p>“I am not as good at talking as you are and I
have but little to say for myself. Possibly, like the
parrot, I think the more. Perhaps, some day, I may
tell you something that I would never say to another
soul. Although you and I have met so seldom,
we know one another extraordinarily well, and if
there is any truth in the fashionable doctrine of
Theosophy, we were united by a close tie in some
former existence. Do you know I had that feeling
when we passed one another on Slacklands Marsh?
Well now, won’t you tell me the great secret?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I agreed, “but not at present. Do you
see,” I continued, pointing over at the stand rendezvous,
“everyone is there already!&mdash;they are waving
what looks like a tablecloth.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, so they are!” he exclaimed, as we
put our horses into a canter. “All right, then,”
and he looked at me expressively, “your thrilling
story must be continued in our next!”</p>

<span>AN UNWELCOME VISITOR</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we dismounted at the stand we found that
<i>chotah hazri</i> had already started, and was, so to
speak, half-way round the course. As I received my
teacup from her hands, I gathered that my chaperon
was displeased with me&mdash;my tardy arrival was not
“amusing.” Perhaps she thought that I had made
myself too conspicuous in riding off and having a
long <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Captain Falkland, although we
<i>were</i> old friends; therefore, on the way home I
carefully avoided his company and gave him no
opportunity of resuming our conversation, keeping
close to Major Mills and Ronnie.</p>

<p>Within a week of my arrival at Secunderabad I
seemed to have slipped into my place in the station
as Mrs. Soames’s guest and Captain Lingard’s sister,
and as they were both popular everything was made
pleasant for me. My singing was extravagantly
praised. I loved music, but satisfaction in my
own performances had hitherto been cheapened and
damped, especially by Aunt Mina, who had no ear,
and assured me that my execution on the piano was
all right, but my singing was far too dramatic and
theatrical, also that I <i>screamed</i> like a curlew!</p>

<p>We had tennis, riding parties, dinners, dances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
sports on the Futeh Maidan, and boating excursions
on the lake. Besides this, there was plenty of work
for the garrison&mdash;manœuvres, night attacks, field days
and route marching. As the weather was now cool, the
general, a particularly active soldier, kept his staff
incessantly occupied, and I saw but little of Captain
Falkland. On the other hand, I saw far too much
of Mr. Balthasar. He appeared to be continually
about the club, and had been actually introduced
to me by Ronnie!</p>

<p>I felt secretly comforted when Mrs. Soames
agreed with me that he was “a most odious
person.”</p>

<p>“Of course, my dear,” she said, “he is in the
club, and that says all. He has lots of money and
subscribes to everything, has a fine house down in
Chudderghat, gives men’s dinner parties, and is said
to have extraordinary influence in the city&mdash;not of
London, but of Hyderabad. All the same, in my
opinion, he is just an adventurer, but he is received
at the Residency, and Secunderabad people have
him at their houses. He shall never enter mine!
He gives me the idea of being some horrible human
bloodsucker, and I believe&mdash;though I dare not say
it in public&mdash;that he is a money-lender.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Soames was very intimate with Lady Dynevor,
the wife of the Resident. We frequently went down
to Chudderghat to tiffin and to tennis parties, and
I was taken to see something of the great Mohammedan
city: for instance, the Char Minar, the
Nizam’s palace (the finest in India), standing on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
high terrace; the façade, a double row of Corinthian
columns, the interior with its marble stairs, statues
and treasures&mdash;truly the Palace Beautiful!</p>

<p>At the Residency I made the acquaintance of a
delightful Mohammedan lady. Her name was Zora;
she came to tiffin when there were no men, arriving
in a closed car and heavily veiled. She was no darker
than an Italian, and very handsome. Her figure
was slight and willowy, and she was undoubtedly the
most graceful creature I had ever seen. Her father,
a Nawab of great wealth, was one of the ministers
to the Nizam; she was his only daughter&mdash;and a
widow. Zora was an accomplished musician, and
played the piano magnificently. As she spoke
English fluently we soon became friends. Zora
informed me that she had often been in England,
where she dressed and went about precisely like other
people, and was often taken for an Italian!</p>

<p>“I used to go to your theatres, dinners and
garden parties, and enjoyed myself immensely. In
London I often rode on the top of a motor-bus, but
as soon as I come back to India I become <i>gosha</i>.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Soames and I visited her at her father’s
palace, an imposing abode, with many servants in
livery, wide staircases and long corridors, the floors
of which were covered with white linen. Zora’s own
apartments were furnished English fashion, though
there were divans piled with cushions, and wonderful
Persian rugs; here, too, was a splendid Steinway
piano, a writing-table, Chesterfield couches, and
bookcases crammed with French and English books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span></p>

<p>At tea-time we were joined by her father (the
minister), a handsome elderly man with suave,
courteous manners and an expressive voice. He
spoke English perfectly, talked with ease, and told
us many interesting things about the city. The
Nawab had two sons who had been educated at
Harrow and were now in the Nizam’s forces, but I
could see that Zora the beautiful was the pride of
his life.</p>

<p>I had now been a whole month with Mrs. Soames,
and made many acquaintances&mdash;for instance, all
the officers of the “Lighthearts”&mdash;and began to feel
myself almost one of the regiment. I had also been
made known to most of the people at the club and
a number of girls&mdash;among these my particular friends
were Emily and Mabel Grey, and we met almost
daily.</p>

<p>As Quarter No. 30 was vacant I insisted upon
moving into it. I hated to feel as if I were imposing,
though I believe Mrs. Soames really liked me; I
did my best to help her in every way I could, by
writing notes, reading aloud&mdash;as her sight was
indifferent&mdash;going messages down to the bazaar
when she was busy, and shopping at Cursetjee’s
or Spencer’s and various places in Oxford Street,
Secunderabad. I liked Colonel Soames, too, but somehow
he resembled the countryman and the claret&mdash;one
never got much “forrarder.” I rode with him,
danced with him, and sang to him, but he was often
preoccupied and inaccessible, and had no real interest
in the world beyond the regiment. The regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
was his fetish; its fitness, smartness and fame were
all he cared for, and I could see that he ruled his
officers and men with an iron hand, encased in a
somewhat thin velvet glove.</p>

<p>Hospitable Mrs. Soames was reluctant to part
with me, although I was to be such a near neighbour.
Quarter 30, or the end bungalow, faced towards
Trimulgherry Rock. Our abode was a good size;
three large lofty rooms, and two slips at either side.
The compound was considerable; the late occupant
had kindly started a vegetable garden, our avenue
was lined with cork trees in flower, and the whole
front veranda was enshrouded in luxuriant creeper.
With fresh matting and pretty bamboo furniture,
chintzes, cushions, and solid indispensables, Ronnie
and I made the end bungalow very nice indeed.
He took great pains in hanging pictures, putting up
heads, and fixing draperies. Kind Mrs. Soames lent
me some plate just for the time, as she had more
than she wanted, and I could return it to her when
the regiment went home. This was a move which
I could not bear to contemplate, but I kept my
thoughts to myself.</p>

<p>Ronnie and I instituted a most happy ménage.
We shopped together in Oxford Street, and there
picked up glass and china, lamps and stores. Our
stables held a smart dog-cart and horse, my stud-bred
grey and Ronnie’s three polo ponies, which he also
hacked. Our household consisted of a cook and
<i>tannyketch</i> (an individual who carries the market
basket, plucks fowl, and is, in short, the kitchen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
slavey). There was Michael the big butler, a dressing
<i>chokra</i>, my ayah&mdash;now happily situated in one of our
go-downs, with a whole brood of relations&mdash;and the
usual <i>mali</i> and <i>bheesti</i>, etc.</p>

<p>I had invested in a ponderous account book with
a lock and key, and was the household purse-bearer.
We boldly adventured on little luncheons and dinners;
numbers of people called, and, if we had been so disposed,
we could have dined out nearly every night.
On Sundays we always had supper at the colonel’s.
I sat with Mrs. Soames in the garrison church, accompanied
her to dances, and though I now was a “Miss
Sahib” with an establishment of my own, was still
more or less under her friendly wing.</p>

<p>Besides Mabel and Emily Grey and Mrs. Mills, I
had two friends who were a considerable contrast,
Zora and Mrs. Lakin. Ronnie and I had dined at
the Lakins’&mdash;a most overwhelming repast&mdash;and now
and then Mrs. Lakin herself came to see me and gave
me hints about housekeeping and kept me well posted
in the proper price of ghee and charcoal. I could see
that she took a motherly interest in me, now that
her own girls were far afield, and I was grateful for
the same.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wolfe had honoured me with a visit, so had
Mrs. Potter. I instinctively felt that she did not
accept me for what I may call “my face value.”
To use a common but disagreeable expression, I think
she figuratively “smelt a rat”! Our interview was a
long series of sharp questions and nervous answers,
and I was nearly exhausted and at my wits’ end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
when, to my great relief, Ronnie and his friend
Mr. Arkwright made their appearance and she took
her departure.</p>

<p>Among my other visitors was Zora, who came
by special appointment when I was alone, and we
mutually enjoyed music, tea and conversation. Captain
Falkland also called, and one who was not
equally welcome&mdash;Mr. Balthasar. I think when I
beheld his great big grey motor turning into the
compound, I would have said “Durwaza bund,”
only that Ronnie, who seemed surprisingly excited,
cried:</p>

<p>“By Jove!&mdash;here’s old Balthasar!&mdash;just the very
man I wanted to see.”</p>

<p>He was just the man I did <i>not</i> want to see, but
naturally I was bound to be civil in my own house,
and although he oozed affability and admiration at
every pore, I was not softened. No! Could I ever
forgive his insolent wink? However, Ronnie and he
appeared to be on excellent terms, and he accompanied
my brother into his little office or writing-room,
there to confer together on some important
subject, which they declared would not interest me.
Later, as Ronnie was obliged to go to barracks, I
was left to entertain Mr. Balthasar alone.</p>

<p>After discussing a recent gymkhana, Ronnie’s
prowess in the Loyd-Lindsay and tent-pegging, he
worked the conversation round to Silliram.</p>

<p>“Do you ever hear from your friends there?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>“I do not know that I have any friends there at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
present,” I answered evasively. “All the people
I knew have gone down to the plains.”</p>

<p>“I was over at the Katchookan Mines last week
for a couple of days and put up with the Hayes-Billingtons,”
he continued.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you? How is she?” I asked.</p>

<p>“She looked awfully seedy&mdash;no beauty <i>now</i>, so
thin and faded. It’s a horrible hole for a woman;
nothing to do, hardly a soul to speak to. Billington
is in the mines all day, and of course for
a lady accustomed to a very&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;flash sort of
life, as she was, when Mrs. de Lacy, it must be a
sort of hell on earth&mdash;minus the company. She
was asking for you; she seems awfully fond of you.
I say,” and he hitched his chair a few inches closer
and lowered his voice, “it’s a pity that your people
at home were so slack about making inquiries, eh?”
Here he rolled his pale grey eyes at me. “It’s an
awful handicap for a girl to start out in this country
as the companion of a woman of loose character.”</p>

<p>I clenched my hands tightly, but held my tongue.</p>

<p>“Luckily for you,” he continued, “the matter
has been kept dark down here. There are only one
or two people in the know, and I am one of them,
and, my dear young lady, you can always rely on
<i>me</i>.” As he made this unctuous announcement he
patted me on the arm with odious familiarity.
“Your brother and I are tremendous pals; he is
an awfully clever chap, and I would do more than
that for him&mdash;and for <i>you</i>&mdash;but you must not be
so stand-off, you know&mdash;let us be friends, <i>great</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
friends. Ronnie must bring you down to tiffin and
I will show you my little bungalow, and you will
let me take you for some drives in my new car.
Perhaps you would like to go out to the mines one
day and see Mrs. Hayes-Billington?”</p>

<p>These astounding invitations almost took my
breath away, and as I was endeavouring to invent
some polite excuse he resumed. “Not a soul need
know about the little expedition; it’s only a run
of a hundred miles, and if we went next week&mdash;there
is a full moon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” I said at last, “but
I could not possibly accompany you to see Mrs.
Hayes-Billington, although I am really sorry for
her loneliness.”</p>

<p>“Then why not come, my dear young lady?
Your visit would do her so much good. It would
be a charity, for, upon my soul, she looks as if her
heart were breaking. No one except your brother
will ever hear of our trip. It will be quite under
the rose! Come, come! Why not do good by
stealth?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I do not care to do anything by
stealth,” I answered stiffly.</p>

<p>“And what about false pretences?” he demanded,
now changing his tone, and once more patting
me on the arm.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I asked sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, here is a beautiful young lady”&mdash;he
rolled his eyes expressively&mdash;“she is the belle of
Secunderabad&mdash;as even the women allow. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
shines like a star; the station is full of her
praises, she is so sweet and unspoiled; so simple and
so <i>innocent</i>! Her singing and her dancing are the
admiration of everyone who has the happiness to
be in her company. She is supposed to have just
arrived from England&mdash;yet all the time the poor
foolish people are being deceived. Previous to
her arrival here, the beautiful innocent young lady
has been living in a hill station with a notoriously
bad woman. Of course I shall keep all this as secret
as the grave&mdash;but, my darling girl, what are you
going to do for <i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>For a moment I was too stunned to speak or to
stir. At last I got up, walked over to the door
leading into the veranda, and beckoning to our
butler, said:</p>

<p>“Please order this gentleman’s car!”</p>

<p>Then I turned my back on Mr. Balthasar and
retired to my own apartment, feeling, as Mrs. Paget-Taylor
had once expressed it, “completely unhinged.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_17">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span>A COMPROMISE</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> modest ménage at No. 30 was a very happy one,
at any rate for the first three months. We were like
a pair of children playing at housekeeping, and often
when we sat down to dinner at our daintily arranged
table we would nod and laugh at one another, for
somehow it all seemed unreal and too good to be
true. Here was indeed “a place in the sun.”</p>

<p>I looked carefully after Ronnie’s comforts, ordered
his favourite dishes, and was always up early,
ready to give him <i>chotah hazri</i> in our shady veranda
before he rode off to parade. I did my utmost to
entertain his friends, especially Roger Arkwright,
who soon became my friend as well. He was a
tall fair young man, with square shoulders and a
pleasant square face. He came in and out as often
as he pleased and we called him “The tertium quid.”
I wondered if, occasionally, his visits were not nicely
timed so as to meet Mabel and Emily Grey&mdash;especially
Mabel&mdash;who were often with me, practising new
songs or just running over merely to idle and talk.
However that may be, Roger Arkwright gave me
valuable help with our garden. We had a splendid
show of roses in pots, and a respectable amount of
lettuce and tomatoes. He also took a personal and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
greedy interest in my flock of ducks, who every
morning, after their early breakfast, departed <i>en
masse</i> for some distant pond, returning quacking
and hungry at sundown. So punctual were they
that one could almost set a watch by these worthy
and business-like birds.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mills, my next-door neighbour, would often
step over the wall dividing our compounds and
bring her work and talk to me. She had two small
children with her and a boy at home, about whom
she was always anxious, as he was a delicate little
fellow and had no grannies. The Millses were not
well off; she often discussed ways and means, the
cook’s accounts and bazaar bills, and I agreed with
her that in the East rupees seemed to vanish like
mists in the sun!</p>

<p>“You see,” she said, “this is a smart regiment
and the mess bills are heavy. The colonel will have
everything done in the most expensive style, and
when I see the monthly amount my heart goes into
my boots&mdash;and yet I don’t want to be mean; as
George says, ‘the reputation of the regiment and
its traditions must come before everything else.’
For you it is all right, of course, as you and Ronnie
have lots of money.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” I answered. “Speaking
for myself, I have just a hundred and fifty pounds
a year, besides an allowance from my uncle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but your brother is well known to be
wealthy. Why, last year he gave three thousand
rupees for a polo pony! He offers prizes for the men’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
sports, he entertains at the club, and is always most
generous and open-handed.”</p>

<p>To all of which statements I could but assent.
Ronnie and I did not interfere with each other’s
arrangements, or rather I never interfered with his.
We rode together, drove down to the club in the
afternoon, and at balls danced the first waltz.
When at home we were rarely alone; there was sure
to be somebody dropping in for breakfast, lunch or
dinner. In India these casual guests make practically
no difference in the menu, just a little more
water to the soup, another cutlet and another savoury.
My cook was really a treasure; we were on excellent
terms; I never cut him down, or weighed his purchases,
or fined him, as Mrs. Mills did her man,
and he took a real pride in his work. I, too, cooked,
and had installed a small stove in the back veranda,
where Mabel Grey and I experimented with recipes
and made delicious meringues, rock cakes, and
original savouries. The little dinners at No. 30
enjoyed quite a regimental reputation. Sometimes
Ronnie dined at mess&mdash;always on Guest Night&mdash;sometimes
there was a bachelor dinner at the club.
On these occasions I dined with the Millses or the
Soameses, or enjoyed in preference a quiet meal (such
as a poached egg) at home, made up accounts and
worked off arrears of correspondence. Somehow, now
that I led such a busy life, with continual goings out
and comings in, I was exceedingly thankful to have
a short breathing space. Ronnie, too, had rarely a
spare minute; what with parades, orderly room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
guards, rifle-shooting, arranging polo matches, and
playing cricket, he was always busy. Sometimes
I had known him to sit up in his little den writing
till midnight.</p>

<p>All our lives we had been the best of friends and
comrades. Sad to relate, our first difference of opinion
was about Mr. Balthasar. One evening Ronnie
came home from the club looking alarmingly put
out. At first I thought he might have had a bad
evening at bridge, or that one of the polo ponies had
broken down, but I knew I should hear all about it
after dinner, when we smoked in the veranda&mdash;I too
enjoyed a cigarette, an accomplishment I had learnt
from Mrs. Hayes-Billington. I took to it by her
advice on one of our gloomy, depressing wet days.
She declared that smoking soothed the nerves. So
far as I knew I had not any nerves to soothe, but
I snatched at a new experience!</p>

<p>As soon as we were comfortably installed in two
deep chairs Ronnie began:</p>

<p>“I say, I’ve an awfully big crow to pluck with
you, old girl.”</p>

<p>“All right,” I answered gaily. “I have got a
bag to put the feathers in&mdash;now show me the crow?”</p>

<p>“I met Balthasar in the club this evening. He has
been away for a week or two; he was frightfully
black with me for some reason, and then, when I
asked him why he had the hump, it all came out! It
seems that that day when he called upon you to pay
his respects in full state, and was talking to you and
advising you with regard to a certain affair&mdash;of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
course I mean Mrs. Hayes-Billington&mdash;you actually
rose and summoned your servant and turned him
out of the house! Now I want an explanation?”</p>

<p>“And you shall have it,” I answered with some
heat, and then as rapidly and as forcibly as I could
find words I poured out my wrath and the whole
tale. I spoke of Balthasar’s insinuations, his vague
threats, his loathsome familiarity, and his audacious
suggestion that I should accompany him to the mines
to see Mrs. Hayes-Billington. I declared that when
he threatened me and insinuated that I was in his
power and living under false pretences, I naturally
got up and commanded Michael to send for his
car. At last I ceased, breathless. For a moment
Ronnie did not speak, but I felt instinctively that he
was impressed by my information.</p>

<p>“I see,” he said, “the fellow lost his head&mdash;I
know he admires you enormously.”</p>

<p>At this announcement I stamped my foot&mdash;old
style.</p>

<p>“But, Sis, you must remember that he is a
foreigner and make allowances; they are all so hasty
and emotional. Balthasar assured me he had come
to see you with the kindest intentions, and that you
threw him out of the house as if he were a mad dog!
He says he shall never forget the way you drew
yourself up and looked at him.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear that,” I answered heartlessly.
“I hope I have planted an evergreen in his
memory, and that I may never see him again.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, for that matter,” and Ronnie gave a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
rather nervous cough, “it would not do for you and
him to be really at daggers drawn, for he has been
awfully useful to me; in fact, I may say I am under
some obligation to him. And so are you, old girl, if he
continues to keep his mouth shut.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Ronnie,” I protested, “<i>why</i> should
we have anything to do with such a horror? I’d
a thousand times rather be under an obligation to
Baker, the butler at Torrington.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s a different affair. He is one of
our own race; and, if it comes to obligations, I have
borrowed a sov. from Baker before now! These
Levantines are different; so emotional and sensitive,
and childishly thin-skinned. With them you are
either black or white. I prefer to be on good terms
with Balthasar. He works many strings in the
financial world&mdash;half the people here run after
him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And the other half run away from him,” I
supplemented.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, he gets stacks of invitations; he
is our local Rothschild, and quite an <i>ami de la maison</i>
at the Residency.”</p>

<p>“I can hardly believe that,” I said rudely; “and
anyway, he is not, you will admit, what we would
call a <i>white</i> man.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you this, Sis, that his face was grey
with rage when he was talking to me this evening.
Look here,” and Ronnie rose and stood before me with
his hands in his pockets, “you will have to patch
up a truce with old Balthasar, and I will bear the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
olive-branch. We can ask him up to lunch or dinner
to soothe his wounded feelings, and you must put
your fastidiousness in your pocket and assume a
virtue if you have it not! I say, I don’t often ask
you to do something&mdash;but I do beg of you to oblige
me in this one thing, as a great favour.”</p>

<p>His expression was so grave and anxious that I
could not but yield.</p>

<p>“All right, Ronnie, you know I never can refuse
you anything. I will do my best to smother my
feelings and, much as I loathe him, be civil to Balthasar
in order to please you.”</p>

<p>Then Ronnie kissed me warmly, and said:</p>

<p>“That’s a good old girl! I dare say he rubbed you
the wrong way. He’s not a bad sort, I assure you, and
rather a friend of mine. Now, I’ll tell you of a friend
of yours who always rubs <i>me</i> the wrong way&mdash;it’s
that fellow Falkland! I can’t stand his slow, deliberate
manner. Of course the women here have spoiled
him and run after him because he’ll have a title
some day; and he’s such a strait-laced beggar,
thinks gambling is wrong, at least for anything more
than eight annas a hundred at bridge. He doesn’t
bet, and he scowls if you tell him a sultry story;
and this comes well from a fellow who is in the
fastest cavalry regiment in India!”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you about Captain Falkland,”
was my bold reply. “I’m sure he’s not a bit of a prig,
and I think he’s right about betting, when many
of the young fellows here have no money to spare.
However, you keep your friend and I’ll keep mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Ronnie, “only don’t let’s
invite them here together, for I happen to know
that they hate one another like poison. And now
I’m going to send off a chit to Balthasar. I’ll tell
him you’re very sorry, but that he quite misunderstood
you; you were going out to tiffin at the
general’s with Mrs. Soames, and were already late.”</p>

<p>“What a frightful story!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll be all right,” said Ronnie as he passed
into the drawing-room. “I expect he’ll take it with
a grain of salt.”</p>

<span>THE RESIDENCY BALL</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the middle of November, months had flown
like weeks, and days like hours. The annual great
ball at the Residency was imminent. For a ball no
more auspicious place could possibly be selected
than the splendid Durbar Hall, with its fine teak
floor and crystal chandeliers&mdash;said to have been
“borrowed” from the French at Pondicherry.
Everyone on Government House list had received
invitations, and guests were flocking not only from
the city of Hyderabad and the cantonments, but
from Raichore and even far distant Poona. I had
a lovely new ball-dress held in reserve for this
supreme occasion. It was the white and silver gown
which I had worn when Mrs. Hayes-Billington told me
that I was “lovely.” Of course she was a flatterer,
but, whatever I might be, I don’t think there could
be any question with respect to my frock.</p>

<p>Just as my toilet was completed and I was taking
“a last fond look” the ayah introduced an enormous
bouquet on a tray. It was not my style of bouquet
in the least&mdash;tight in structure and overpowering
as to perfume; moreover, I had grave suspicions as
to the donor.</p>

<p>I inspected it, sniffed at it, and then handed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
back to the ayah and told her that she might keep
it for herself.</p>

<p>“What for I doing such stupid nonsense?” she
asked in her most querulous key. “I putting in
missie’s bath tub for to-night; to-morrow the mali
will arrange in best vases in drawing-room.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to see the flowers again,” I replied
impatiently, “take them away&mdash;<i>throw</i> them away!”</p>

<p>Whilst I was still commanding, and she entreating,
my official chaperon called for me in the brougham.
Ronnie and the colonel had driven down together in
the dog-cart. It was rather a long journey to
Chudderghat, and when we arrived at the Residency
we found the great steps encompassed with such
a crowd of carriages and motors that we were obliged
to wait for a quarter of an hour before it came to our
turn.</p>

<p>The scene in the ballroom was dazzling. Such
brilliant functions are rarely witnessed in England;
putting aside the vast well-proportioned hall, its
blazing chandeliers and banks of tropical flowers
and palms, the company was unique&mdash;crowds of
pretty women and girls in fresh smart gowns,
officers in all sorts of uniform, from the ordinary
volunteer in black and silver to a gorgeous
Golconda Lancer. There were present many
nobles from the city, wearing magnificent satin
and brocade coats encrusted with gold embroidery,
their turbans glittering with aigrettes of diamonds,
their throats encircled with enormous pearls, their
belts a mass of precious stones. These&mdash;members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
of the Court of the Nizam&mdash;were merely ornamental
and dignified spectators.</p>

<p>Most of the other guests were swinging round
and round to the strains of a delightful waltz, swaying
and revolving in time to the beguiling violins. What
a riot of colour and movement, of costumes and
figures!</p>

<p>With difficulty we made our way to the end
of the room to speak to Lady Ryder, and there
we halted for a moment and looked about us. A
waltz was over and people were walking about or
talking in groups. I noticed Mrs. Lakin in a much-creased
black velvet, old-fashioned Swami ornaments
and two-button kid gloves.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t had a new dress since she married
her daughters,” explained Mrs. Soames, who was
herself excessively smart in a mauve confection direct
from Jay’s. “She rarely goes out,” she continued,
“but feels it a duty to be present on this occasion.
I expect she will sneak off home before supper.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wolfe flared by in a wonderful orange garment;
she was looking unusually brilliant, her black
eyes blazing with excitement. Partners were beginning
to discover me, and in a short time my programme
was crowded, even “extra extras” were bespoke.
The band was playing another delicious waltz, and
I was soon swimming round with Ronnie, an absolutely
perfect partner&mdash;we always danced the first waltz
together. My next was with Roger Arkwright;
after him with Captain Gloag the adjutant, a stiff
formal individual who invariably wore a harassed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
and careworn expression. Captain Gloag was succeeded
by Captain Falkland, who had coolly put himself
down for two waltzes and the supper dance.
Although we had met pretty often at polo, tennis
parties, gymkhanas and the boat club, yet, since
that day at Moul Ali, we had never had any really
serious conversation. Recently he had been away
with the general on a tour of inspection, and had only
returned to Secunderabad on the night of the ball.</p>

<p>Just towards the end of our second waltz we
were resting after a long round, looking on at the
gay and whirling crowd and remarking on various
people. There was Colonel Grey gyrating with
Mabel, and Roger Arkwright leaning against the
wall following the couple with an expression that
was all but murderous. Suddenly I was accosted
by Mr. Balthasar, glossy, prosperous and heavily
scented, wearing an enormous diamond as a shirt-stud,
and a pair of skin-tight lavender gloves. We
had in a way patched up a truce, and he had
actually dined with us at No. 30&mdash;but not to meet
my present partner. Having bowed himself before
me, he said:</p>

<p>“As I was so unfortunate as to find your programme
full, my very good friend your brother has
given me his second dance, which I think is number
fourteen?”</p>

<p>For a moment I was speechless with annoyance,
and then I said: “I didn’t know there were such
things as second-hand dances.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, when charming young ladies are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
great demand such things can be arranged. Will
you not dance number fourteen with me?”</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked brusquely, “a square?”</p>

<p>“No, it is a waltz.”</p>

<p>Now, I found myself in a most disagreeable
dilemma. For Ronnie’s sake I must not offend this
creature; for the sake of my own self-respect nothing
would induce me to waltz with him.</p>

<p>“You may have a square, number thirteen,” I
said haughtily. Balthasar rolled his eyes alarmingly,
and became a shade more sallow, but rallied and said:</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Lingard; half a loaf is better
than no bread,” and without another word he retired.</p>

<p>During this little scene Captain Falkland had
stood beside me in rigid silence. I thought he might
have helped me out. In some ways an A.D.C. is
expected to be ready with expedients. But no,
he remained stiff and immovable, as if he had been
a figure in armour.</p>

<p>“Just one more turn before the band stops,”
he said, and I was whirled away.</p>

<p>When the waltz was over we strolled into the
great veranda to look for seats, and came to a large
chintz-covered lounge on which Sally Payne was
enthroned in conspicuous solitude. As usual, she
was beautifully dressed and wore a string of fine and
unquestionably real pearls. When we approached
she patted the seat beside her, and I sat down.</p>

<p>“Hallo, Sally!” said Captain Falkland. “Patience
on a monument, and all alone! What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that I have sent my partner to fetch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
me an ice. Did you know that Captain Falkland and
I are cousins?”&mdash;addressing me. “He did not
recognise me at first because I had changed my name,
although I am still ‘an unappropriated blessing.’
Formerly I was Sally Rivers. A relation died and
left me a fortune”&mdash;and she touched her pearls
significantly&mdash;“and the name of Payne. So for
once pain brought pleasure! I remember Falkland
as a dreadful little boy. I had not seen him for
twenty years until the other day; he has grown up
better than I expected.”</p>

<p>“Sorry I can’t return the compliment, Sally,”
he broke in. “It is most unseemly for you to be
privateering round the world all by yourself.”</p>

<p>“By no means,” she rejoined. “I led a very
pinched, narrow sort of life for years, and now I’m
having my little fling. Some day perhaps I may
settle down. After my forty-fifth birthday has
passed I shall marry the first man that asks me.
There! You are both witnesses. Miss Lingard,
you haven’t spoken a word. A penny for your
thoughts?”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking that we are all related,”
I answered. “Captain Falkland pretends that the
Falklands and the Lingards are cousins.”</p>

<p>“Pretends!” he expostulated, “I do like that!
Allow me to refer you to the family pedigree.”</p>

<p>“If Captain Falkland and I are cousins and you
are his cousin, and Mrs. Wolfe is your cousin&mdash;we
must belong to the same tribe!”</p>

<p>“Very well, Miss Lingard,” said Sally, “in future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
I shall call you by your Christian name, and when I
die you must promise to go into second mourning.
Ah, here comes my ice at last! Strawberry, I hope.
And now you, my two nice new cousins, may pass
on”; and without further discussion we took her at
her word.</p>

<p>Captain Falkland had put himself down on my
card for the supper dance, and I was just about to
go in to supper with Roger Arkwright when he
appeared, and stood before me and said:</p>

<p>“May I have the honour of taking you in?”</p>

<p>“I have promised Mr. Arkwright.”</p>

<p>“But you are engaged to me for the supper
dance. You must have supper before the dance&mdash;otherwise
how is it a supper dance?”</p>

<p>“That is a funny argument,” exclaimed Roger,
and he glanced at Falkland and laughed.</p>

<p>I don’t exactly know how it came to pass, but
my cavalier good-naturedly relinquished me, and I
presently found myself walking away in company with
Captain Falkland. As we passed down a corridor
I saw approaching a rather striking pair, a tall
man in uniform and a tall girl in white. As we
came nearer I discovered, with a mental start, that
the couple were ourselves!</p>

<p>“I had no idea it was a mirror,” I exclaimed.
“I thought we were meeting two strangers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a study in gold and silver,” he replied,
referring to the gold on his uniform and the silver on
my dress. “Now that we have seen ourselves as
others see us, what is your opinion?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>I found this question rather embarrassing, and
made no reply, but I could not help recognising the
fact that we had made an effective picture.</p>

<p>The supper-room proved to be crowded; it looked
as if every chair and every knife and fork were in
use. After steering me through blocks of guests
and waiters my partner managed to secure two
places by squeezing in at the corner of a table occupied
by a large and noisy party, including Mrs. Potter;
by bad luck Captain Falkland’s seat was next to hers.
I say “bad luck,” as I knew they were as inimical
to one another as cat and dog. He was never to be
seen in her train. For her part, if she found an
opening for giving him a nasty thrust she did not
overlook it. It was her openly expressed opinion
that “he was a shockingly bad A.D.C., and totally
wanting in manners and tact.” Fortunately this
verdict was not supported by the station.</p>

<p>As we talked together of trivial matters I was
aware that all the time Mrs. Potter, though ostensibly
carrying on a conversation with her neighbour, was
listening to every word we said and only waiting
for an opportunity to burst into our <i>tête-à-tête</i>.
Presently she made an intrusive remark, and instantly
she and my partner began to spar. I did not take
any share in the conflict, but talked to a major in
the Tea-Green Lancers, who was on my left&mdash;a most
amusing neighbour, and the best amateur actor in
southern India. As we talked and chaffed I found
myself enacting the rôle of Mrs. Potter, and endeavouring
to overhear what she and Captain Falk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>land
were talking about. Their voices were low, and
among scores of other tongues and the crash of the
band near by I was not particularly successful. I
gathered that repeatedly he attempted to cut short
her flow of speech, but such efforts were paralysed
by her tireless volubility. At last her companions
began to move; they were giving parting toasts.
Turning to my friend with lifted champagne glass I
heard Mrs. Potter say:</p>

<p>“Come now, a pledge, Captain Falkland!”</p>

<p>“All right then, I will,” he answered in a tone of
angry decision, and lifting his glass and looking her
full in the face I distinctly heard:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here’s to the light that lies in woman’s eyes!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And lies&mdash;and lies&mdash;and <i>lies</i>!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“How dare you!” she exclaimed in a furious
undertone. “How dare you insult me!”</p>

<p>“I mentioned no names,” he replied in his coolest
manner; “you asked for a toast, and I gave the first
that came into my head.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Potter listened to his lame explanation
with an expression of concentrated ferocity, then
hastily collecting her party she turned her back
upon him and left the supper-room in what was a
most realistic presentment of high dudgeon!</p>

<p>“I could not help overhearing your toast,” I
said as soon as I had recovered my partner.</p>

<p>“I suppose not. Now, thank goodness, we shall
have elbow room. May I get you some quails in
aspic?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span></p>

<p>“No, thank you,” I replied, “I’ve had soup, and
I never eat at a ball. I believe you have driven Mrs.
Potter away, and made her your enemy for life.”</p>

<p>“She was always <i>that</i>,” he answered with amazing
nonchalance; “she knows me, and I know her. She
cannot spare infants in arms or even the dead. What
a tongue! Mrs. Potter does not leave a feather on
any woman in the station. In the good old days she
would have found herself sitting in the public stocks.”</p>

<p>“Who is she so particularly down on this evening&mdash;a
friend of yours, I imagine?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you will allow me to call you so.”</p>

<p>“So then she was talking of <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will laugh when you hear her latest.
She warns me that you have a mysterious past; that
you came out to India and lived with some disreputable
people long before you dawned on Secunderabad.
I gave her one for her nob, I can tell you!”</p>

<p>For a moment I could not think of any appropriate
reply, and at last I brought out Mrs. Soames’s
well-worn expression, “How amusing!”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it? Well, now shall we go and
dance, or are you dead tired?”</p>

<p>“I’m never tired of dancing,” I answered, as I
rose and collected gloves and fan.</p>

<p>“And what about me?” he said. “I was on
horseback the whole of yesterday, an early inspection
and long railway journey to-day, letters and telegrams
to answer on arrival, gobble down dinner,
dress, come here and reel off a dozen duty dances. I
tell you what! I know a nice cosy nook up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
gallery where we can sit and talk, or rather you shall
talk and I will listen.”</p>

<p>“You are reckoning without me,” I protested.
“I don’t think I’m as great a chatterbox as I used
to be.”</p>

<p>By this time we had ascended into a gallery which
commanded a splendid view of the hall, and as I sat
down Captain Falkland turned to me and said:</p>

<p>“I say, Miss Lingard, I can’t stand that fellow
Balthasar. I can’t imagine what your brother sees
in him.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I.”</p>

<p>“Well, I gathered as much from the way you
choked him off just now, and flung a square dance
at his head.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have even given him that but that
Ronnie has asked me to be civil to him. I think it’s
something to do with racing and that they have a
mutual interest in a speculation.”</p>

<p>“Ah! My own impression of Balthasar is that
he is a wrong ‘un, a sort of parasite hanging on to
the Nawabs in the city, and squeezing out money
and concessions for his schemes in gold and coal.
He has a bad influence over young fellows. Gets
them down to his house in Chudderghat and encourages
them to gamble and drink champagne&mdash;and I
can’t stand seeing him talk to a woman. As he
was jabbering to you this evening I felt half-inclined
to knock him down and wring his neck.”</p>

<p>“That would indeed be strong measures!” I
answered with a laugh. “Ronnie says that, making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
all allowances for his foreign blood, he is not such a
bad fellow.”</p>

<p>“He is a <i>beast</i>!” declared my companion with
vicious energy. “Don’t let’s talk about him any
more. And now,” suddenly sinking into the chair
beside me, “behold, this is the hour and the moment
for you to tell me that <i>secret</i>.”</p>

<p>“Must I really?” I asked with a start.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve hardly been able to sleep for thinking
of it,” and he laughed. “You know you broke off
just in the most interesting place that morning we
rode on the racecourse at Moul Ali.”</p>

<p>“And that was ages ago,” I said. “Fancy restless
nights for weeks&mdash;how too dreadful!”</p>

<p>“Well, now, please put an end to my misery and
impart your awful tale.”</p>

<p>“It is rather awful,” I said gravely, “and I
believe you will be shocked.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no fear of that,” he answered. “It would
be absolutely impossible for <i>you</i> to shock <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well then, you shall judge,” I said. “There
is never smoke without fire. Mrs. Potter has some
grounds for her story,” and sitting up and grasping
my fan tightly in both hands, I turned towards him
and continued with my usual volubility. I described
the visit of the Hayes-Billingtons; her extraordinary
beauty and charm, my aunt’s fascination and temptation;
how Mrs. Hayes-Billington and I had come out
together in the <i>Asphodel</i>.</p>

<p>“Why, she’s just a ditcher,” he interrupted.</p>

<p>“If that means a horrid old tub, she was,” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
assented, “but Captain and Mrs. Hayes-Billington
could not afford the P. and O.”</p>

<p>I next proceeded to draw an attractive, not to say
rosy, picture of the delights of Silliram&mdash;tennis
tournaments, dancing and picnics. Then I came to
a full stop and an appreciable silence ensued.</p>

<p>At last Captain Falkland said abruptly:</p>

<p>“So you were up there for six whole weeks and
have never said a word about it?”</p>

<p>“There is a reason for it,” I answered, looking
at him steadily. “Ronnie and Mrs. Soames know,
and so by great bad luck does Mr. Balthasar. He
was at Silliram and dined with us one night.”</p>

<p>“Well, for Heaven’s sake hurry on and tell me
this mysterious reason, before I go clean mad.”</p>

<p>For a moment I paused, figuratively to pull myself
together. At last I said:</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a Mrs. de Lacy?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask?” he said sharply. “What
can <i>you</i> know about her?”</p>

<p>“Only&mdash;that Mrs. Hayes-Billington was formerly
Mrs. de Lacy.”</p>

<p>On hearing this announcement Captain Falkland
turned hastily round so as to confront me face to
face; he looked almost pale.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> did you say?” he demanded, speaking
in a hard voice, strangely unlike his usual tone.</p>

<p>“Exactly what I have told you,” I replied.
“Of course I need not assure you we never knew this
at Torrington, but you can’t very well ask a lady
for her reference or character as if she were a house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>maid.
Mrs. Hayes-Billington was received with
open arms at Silliram, she became a great social
success, and was taking the principal part in <i>The
Scrap of Paper</i> when one of the audience recognised
her and gave her away.”</p>

<p>“So I should hope. Fancy that woman daring
to undertake to chaperon a young girl! Well, tell
me what happened next?”</p>

<p>“A man who called on us recognised her and
wrote down to Ronnie. He arrived the very morning
after the explosion and took me off at once.
The whole station was shaken to its foundation;
there was a tremendous social earthquake, and
Mrs. Hayes-Billington was cast out of the club just
as if she had been a live cobra. I may confess to you
that in my heart I pitied her. Like some drowning
creature she had struggled to the bank, but was
seized and flung back into deep water.”</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> I can understand why Mrs. Soames was so
anxious to conceal the date of your arrival in India,”
he observed, entirely ignoring my protest, “and so
far she has been wonderfully successful.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Balthasar may give me away,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“In that case, I’ll shoot him! But he won’t.
More likely he’ll try and blackmail you. If he does,
just hand him over to me.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of Mrs. de Lacy?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Hear of her!” he repeated. “Why, I knew her.
She ran away with Vavasour of my regiment. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
met her up in Cashmere. She certainly was extraordinarily
beautiful, and he went clean off his head.
As far as looks and manners went, she snuffed out
every woman in the place&mdash;like the sun among a box
of matches. Her husband was a tough old civilian,
who left her, by all accounts, to run her own rig&mdash;her
career was erratic and notorious.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think she was really so black as she was
painted.”</p>

<p>“<i>Don’t</i> you?” he said, considering me with
amused, sarcastic eyes.</p>

<p>“She was always very nice to me,” I persisted,
“and somehow I could not imagine her otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she was ‘very nice’ to lots of people! I
agree with you there. She was so awfully nice to
old Holliday the judge, that he gave her&mdash;&mdash;” He
paused and said: “Well, well, well, we will let
bygones go and say no more about her, but I’d
give ten pounds to see your Aunt Mina’s face when
she hears the history of your chaperon! I must
say I blame her for the whole thing. It all came
from her indecent haste to get you out of the country.
However, every cloud has a silver lining, and it
was a very nice silver cloud that brought you down
here to <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he took my fan in his hand and was
about to say something more. I felt my heart
galloping like a fire engine, when I heard soft footsteps
and a rustle behind us; Mrs. Wolfe and her
partner had invaded our retreat.</p>

<p>“Oh, you dreadful, faithless man!” she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
dangling her programme before Captain Falkland,
who sprang to his feet. “I’m afraid I shall be
obliged to report you to the general for conduct
unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Our dance
has already begun, so do come along! Captain
Stainforth will take charge of Miss Lingard, who
is no doubt also hiding from her own legitimate
partner!”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Wolfe concluded, she put her white-gloved
hand under Captain Falkland’s arm and led
him unresistingly away.</p>

<p>Her taunt was based on truth! I met my
“legitimate partner” as I entered the ballroom.
The poor man had been hunting for me everywhere,
and as we prepared to launch into the vortex I
noticed my late companion and a yellow gown
whirling together in the middle of the room. He
and I did not exchange another word that evening,
though once or twice&mdash;especially in my set of
lancers with Balthasar&mdash;I noticed him watching me
fixedly. It was four o’clock in the morning, and a
sort of green light of dawn was glimmering along
the horizon, when Mrs. Soames and I drove away
from the Residency. I was very, very tired; as I
sank into my corner of the carriage I felt like a
limp rag doll. Mrs. Soames, on the contrary, was
unusually brisk and lively. She had enjoyed supper,
not once, but twice, whilst I had tasted nothing but
an ice and a cup of soup, and that was scarcely sufficient
to sustain even a girl in hard training for six
hours’ incessant dancing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span></p>

<p>“My dear,” said my companion, “you were an
immense success. I don’t mean to flatter you&mdash;the
young men will do that&mdash;but I quite agree with Lady
Ryder, when she said you looked like the princess
in a fairy tale. Wasn’t it amusing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Soames,” I murmured, in an exhausted
voice.</p>

<p>“I saw that you gave a square dance to that
dreadful Balthasar, but I must confess that you
did not look as if you were enjoying yourself.
More like the goddess of war with a drawn
sword in your hand, or our dear Lady Disdain&mdash;so
amusing!”</p>

<p>“I hated dancing with him,” I said peevishly,
“but Ronnie likes me to be civil to everybody.”</p>

<p>“I danced twice with Ronnie; he is a dear, good
fellow, and never forgets that an old married woman
may still enjoy a waltz. Jim went home about one,
but I, as you see, played the conscientious chaperon.
Thank goodness to-morrow will be Thursday, and
there will be no parade, and everyone can enjoy a
Europe morning.”</p>

<p>“I feel as if I could stay in bed all day,” I
murmured.</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear,” protested my companion,
“you must come to tiffin with me. We will talk over
the ball; how everyone looked and behaved, and
you shall tell me about your partners, and which
of them you liked best?”</p>

<p>As the ayah was undressing me that morning,
she asked me in a drowsy voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span></p>

<p>“Where got missie’s fan?”</p>

<p>Where indeed! Then I suddenly remembered
how Captain Falkland had taken it away. What
had he done with it? There are no pockets in
uniform. In the surprise caused by Mrs. Wolfe’s
sudden descent upon us he must have stuffed it
into the breast of his coat. I rather hoped that
he would keep it!</p>

<span>“YES&mdash;OR NO?”</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days after the ball, Captain Falkland called
at No. 30 and left my fan with a nice little note,
and I must admit that I was sincerely sorry to have
missed him.</p>

<p>We were now beginning to make a certain amount
of preparation for a move; the regiment had been
three years in Secunderabad and was due to go to England
by the season’s reliefs. Many people were sending
round their auction lists, their <i>dirzees</i> were contriving
warm clothes suitable for an English winter, horses
and traps had been bespoke, and most of the polo
ponies were already sold.</p>

<p>“There is no use,” said the colonel (who always
gripped time by the forelock), “in leaving everything
to the last moment, and we shall probably find
ourselves on the high seas some time in February.”</p>

<p>I confess that I could not endure this prospect,
although I prudently kept my own counsel. Already
I had learnt that it is unpardonable to announce
that you are not delighted to go back to England,
but would much prefer to remain in India. With
respect to this guilty secret Mrs. Lakin and I were
of one mind. I should mention that after all I had
only enjoyed the best of India, and I loved the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
country; I had never experienced a hot season, and
had only seen the bright side of life&mdash;beautiful
Silliram, imposing Hyderabad, the dignified noblemen
of the Nizam’s Court, and the warm-hearted Anglo-Indian
community.</p>

<p>At this time&mdash;which was shortly before Christmas&mdash;Ronnie
was unusually busy. He rarely had a
spare hour to ride with me of a morning, or to
drive me down to the tennis courts. The colonel
was “so beastly fussy,” he said, and there was such
a lot to do when a regiment was under orders for home.
Ronnie was often late for dinner, as he would gallop
down to the club for a game of rackets or billiards&mdash;“something
to work off orderly room and red
tape”&mdash;and there he often forgot both time&mdash;and
me!</p>

<p>One evening I was sitting in the drawing-room,
patiently awaiting his return, when I heard someone
ride up, and called out: “Oh, Ronnie, I’m
afraid your dinner is a cinder!”</p>

<p>As there was no reply I looked over my shoulder
and, to my amazement, beheld Captain Falkland
standing in the doorway. It was after eight o’clock.
What could have brought him? Perhaps he had
come to break the news of an accident to my brother&mdash;who
rode and drove at headlong speed.</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?” I asked, springing
to my feet.</p>

<p>“Nothing to anyone that concerns you,” he
answered; “only to <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“I hope it is not serious?” I said, feeling not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
little bewildered by this late visit. “Won’t you sit
down?”</p>

<p>“I had a cable from home,” he began, and I
knew from his voice that he was nervous. “My
father has had a paralytic seizure, and I’m off to
England to-night. The general has been most
awfully kind about it,” he paused for a moment,
and then went on: “I need scarcely say that I could
not leave the country without saying good-bye to
<i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>I felt my face glowing, and murmured a civility
that was I am afraid unintelligible.</p>

<p>“You remember,” he continued, “that morning
at Moul Ali when I declared I would say something
to you that I could never tell to another soul. Well,
now I am here to say it. I have come to ask if you
will be my wife.”</p>

<p>For a moment I felt almost stunned by this unexpected
question, and then filled with a sense of
exquisite tremulous joy.</p>

<p>“I have always been in love with you, as you
may have guessed, and I’ve rushed up here in this
abrupt unceremonious fashion to put my fate to the
touch before I go home. What is my answer to be&mdash;Yes
or No?”</p>

<p>“They say you will be a lord some day,” I
remarked irrelevantly. “I&mdash;I would never do for
a countess.”</p>

<p>“I entirely disagree with that; but don’t meet
troubles half-way. My cousin is hale and hearty
and only sixty-five; I may die before him. I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
afraid I’m rushing you, but I should like to know
before I leave that you belonged to me; and
yet probably I am a presumptuous idiot, and you
may not care a straw about me. I know I’m
not the only fellow that is in love with you, and I’ve
heard you called the prettiest girl in India.”</p>

<p>I could not restrain a wild hysterical laugh as I
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You are nearly as bad as Mrs. Soames&mdash;she
compared me to a fairy princess.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you are a good fairy, who will make
allowances and forgive this precipitate descent on
you; and now without any more figures of speech&mdash;can
you give me your answer?”</p>

<p>I looked up at him and met his anxious dark eyes.
The “yes” was trembling on my lips when Michael
our big butler flung back the curtain or <i>purdah</i>
between the drawing-room and dining-room and
said:</p>

<p>“The captain sending salaam, dining at club.”
Glancing interrogatively at my companion he added:
“This gentleman dining with missy?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” protested my late caller, “I have only
a few minutes to spare. Shall we go into the
veranda?” was his bold suggestion.</p>

<p>I rose without a word and led the way.</p>

<p>“I am taking silence for consent,” he said, and
there, in the scented darkness, he drew me into his
arms and kissed me.</p>

<p>Sitting hand in hand in the dim light we talked,
and how the time flew! A few minutes became half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
an hour. I was surprisingly silent for me, thrilled
with the dawn of first love and the vibrant attraction
of my companion’s voice.</p>

<p>“I may return before long,” he said. “All
depends on my father; under any circumstances
you will be home in February, and then we will be
married. Meanwhile, I will leave you in charge of
Kipper.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you like to put it in that way,” I answered
gaily. “And about our engagement?”</p>

<p>“It is ‘done finish,’ as they say out here.”</p>

<p>“I would rather it was not given out yet. Time
enough when you return or I go home.”</p>

<p>“I see,” he answered; “you think if you were
ticketed ‘Engaged,’ you would lose half your fun!”</p>

<p>“No indeed,” I protested indignantly, “but I
should hate all the talk; it is not as if you were to be
here&mdash;that would be different.”</p>

<p>“Yes, very different indeed,” and he gave an
audible sigh.</p>

<p>“People might say that it was not true&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You have a humble opinion of the lovely
Miss Lingard,” he interrupted with a laugh, “but
if you insist I could put up a notice in the club, signed
and witnessed; and the general might allow it to be
mentioned in orders. I say, Eva, you <i>are</i> a little
goose.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what your people will think? I’m
sure Aunt Mina won’t give me a good ‘chit,’ and
you know I’ve no money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t talk of money,” he protested impatiently,
“when every second now is worth gold to me. I
shall have you, you will have me, and I feel sure we
shall be awfully happy together. We must tell one or
two friends here about our engagement; for instance,
Mrs. Graham and Mrs. Soames.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should like to tell Mrs. Soames&mdash;I know
she will be so pleased&mdash;and, of course, Ronnie.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that <i>he</i> will be so pleased&mdash;somehow
your brother and I have never hit it off. I
know he is immensely popular and a capital sportsman.
I believe he thinks me a prig&mdash;which I’m not.
I’m a bit older and steadier, that’s all. By the way,
darling, do you know that I am fourteen years your
senior?”</p>

<p>“As if it mattered!” I retorted with scorn.</p>

<p>“Not now, no doubt, but later&mdash;much later&mdash;you
must promise not to throw my bald head and grey
hairs in my face.”</p>

<p>I burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Captain Falkland&mdash;no, I mean Brian&mdash;how can
you talk such nonsense!”</p>

<p>“I suppose because I’m so happy; if the poor
pater were all right I’d not have a wish left! By the
way, about Ronnie, you must influence him, my little
girl. I hear of high play, racing bets and wild-cat
speculations. Try to get hold of the purse strings,
and do your level best to cut him loose from that repulsive
ruffian Balthasar.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try, but lately Ronnie is so changed; not
the least like himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span></p>

<p>“Then be a good fairy, and turn him into a
reformed prince of brothers. I’m giving you one
commission&mdash;another and more important one is,
to take great care of your precious self, my little
sweetheart; be happy, write to me by every mail,
and think of me every hour.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure I shall do that.”</p>

<p>“I often wondered if you ever cast me a thought
after I came to India. Certainly you never answered
my letter.”</p>

<p>“I cast you many thoughts,” I admitted, “and
often wished that we might meet. As for your letter,
this is the first I have heard of it.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be the last! Your aunt shall hear of
it, too. It was properly addressed to Miss Eva
Lingard, Torrington Park. Well, now, time is up.”</p>

<p>“Must you go?” I pleaded impulsively, laying
a detaining hand on his arm. “Oh, we have had
such a few minutes’&mdash;&mdash;” I could not control my
voice.</p>

<p>“Happiness,” he supplemented. “I must have
another inspection before I am off,” and he took
my arm and led me back into the full light of our
kerosene wall lamps. “I know my mother will
love you, Eva, and I want to carry away your picture
in my mind, and describe you faithfully. Well, it
has to come&mdash;our good-bye!”</p>

<p>Brian’s eyes and voice expressed something I
had never known before&mdash;the deep emotion of a
reserved man; and his parting kiss told me all that
his lips found it impossible to utter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span></p>

<p>Then he summoned his syce and horse, and,
without another word or glance, cantered out of the
compound. I listened to the ring of hoofs till they
grew fainter and fainter, then died away completely
in the distance. Rejecting the butler’s sonorous
invitation: “Dinner ready on the table!” I retired
into my own room in a strange, anomalous condition;
rapturously happy yet desperately miserable.
Presently I sat down on the side of my bed and
enjoyed a thoroughly exhaustive cry.</p>

<span>CLOUDS</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I whispered my news to Mrs. Soames she
instantly ejaculated her usual formula:</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>how</i> amusing!”</p>

<p>The colonel’s lady was no less delighted than
surprised, and as full of excitement and importance
as if the match was one of her own contrivance. She
was anxious that we should make the engagement
known. I saw her cast a longing glance at her writing-table,
and knew that she was eager to send nice little
notes to Lady Ryder, Mrs. Wolfe and Mrs. Mills, but
against such a proclamation I set my face, and implored
her to keep the matter, at least for the present,
a dead secret.</p>

<p>Of course I took Ronnie into my confidence; at
first he looked scornfully incredulous, then stupefied.</p>

<p>“I never dreamt it would come to that!” he
said at last. “I can’t think how you two made
it up. I never saw you much together.”</p>

<p>His feelings were contradictory, I could see. He
was not pleased&mdash;and yet again he was pleased.</p>

<p>“You will take the <i>pas</i> of Aunt Mina,” he remarked.
“Won’t she be furious? And, of course,
in a way it’s a grand match. The Falkland family
is as old as the hills, and as proud as Lucifer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
but I could never cotton to Falkland, he has such
strained ideas of honour. You must never discuss
a woman in public, and all that sort of old-fashioned
twaddle. I think you are right to keep the engagement
dark as he is not here. Envious people might
say that the whole thing only existed in your imagination,
and, as I have already observed, you and he
were never very chummy&mdash;although I now remember
that he used to ride up to church here on
Sunday evenings, and always sit where he could
see you.”</p>

<p>The news of Captain Falkland’s sudden departure
for England made quite a stir at the club. Mrs.
Soames assured me that everyone was talking about
it and saying all manner of nice things about him.
In spite of his rather slow manner it appeared that
he had a very active brain. The general and Mrs.
Graham were completely lost without him, as he
had been invaluable to both, as a smart officer and
a tactful A.D.C., never mixing uncongenial people
or sending guests into dinner in wrong seniority and
thereby causing much heart-burning and enmity.</p>

<p>As I did not appear at the club for two or three
days, having a bad cold, I was honoured by a visit
of inspection from Mrs. Potter. She came ostensibly
to see Mrs. Soames, and dropped in on me on the way
in her fine motor-car. She found me sitting in the
veranda with Kipper on my lap, and I think the
spectacle startled her not a little.</p>

<p>As I ushered her into the drawing-room she said,</p>

<p>“As I was up in this part of the world I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
I would just look in on you. I heard at the club
that you were rather seedy.”</p>

<p>“Only a cold and a little touch of fever; I shall
be well by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Is that <i>all</i> that ails you?” and she looked at
me with a malicious glance and added: “Someone
told me that it was a serious heart attack!”</p>

<p>I laughed. I think my laugh annoyed her, for
she said:</p>

<p>“And so your friend Captain Falkland has gone!
That <i>was</i> a sudden flight.”</p>

<p>“I believe his father is very ill.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she murmured meditatively; “or
was it just an excuse to clear out of a compromising
fix and a dangerous neighbourhood?”</p>

<p>As I saw that she was bent on being excessively
spiteful and disagreeable I remained silent.</p>

<p>“I see you have got his dog,” she continued.
“Love me love my dog, eh?”</p>

<p>“The dog was originally mine,” I said.</p>

<p>“Ah, then I suppose you both love him! So you
and Captain Falkland know one another at home?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It is doubtful if he will ever come out again.
We shall all miss him tremendously. Do tell me,
is it true that your brother is not going home with
the regiment, but is trying <i>very</i> hard to get into the
Indian Army?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I answered, “but I do not think
it’s the least likely, or he would certainly have told
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, my dear,” she said, “brothers don’t tell
their sisters everything, and possibly you have your
girlish secrets from him. I think you have some
small trifle up your sleeve&mdash;a little mystery about
your coming to India.”</p>

<p>“I came to India in the usual way,” I answered,
“by sea.”</p>

<p>“And were a most delightful importation! Well,
now I must be going. As you have a sore throat you
really should not talk. Au revoir! I suppose you
will turn up at the club in a day or two?” and with
a smiling farewell she swept out.</p>

<p>It seemed to me about this period that my happy
time was coming to an end. It was not only that
Brian Falkland had gone home and that I missed
him dreadfully&mdash;missed the pleasure of looking
forward to meeting him&mdash;I even missed the little
disappointments when he failed to appear. The
sun did not shine so brightly, nor were the skies
now so blue; also I was haunted by the unpleasant
presentiment that trouble was approaching. Ronnie
was changed. He was strangely altered in the last
few months. His spirits were fitful&mdash;sometimes he was
too noisy, talkative, and excited; sometimes so silent
and in such a mood of black depression that I feared
he was sickening for an illness. To my anxious inquiries
the invariable reply was, “Only a touch of
fever.” His face was paler, there were lines about
his mouth, his eyes had lost their glance of irresistible
gaiety; he often looked haggard and worried&mdash;especially,
I noticed, after he received cables and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
telegrams. At night I could hear him pacing the
compound long, long after he had ostensibly retired
to bed. Ronnie, who had always been so polite and
considerate to our servants, was now impatient,
irritable and overbearing. I had known him to
throw a boot at the <i>chokra</i> and an oath at Michael.</p>

<p>Although I was secretly miserable I followed
Lizzie’s sage advice, and kept my trouble to myself,
nor did I, such was my moral cowardice, venture
to appeal to or question my brother, but maintained
our intercourse on the ordinary everyday level. Since
my early youth at Torrington I had a shrinking
horror of scenes and rows, and once when I had
thrown out a timid feeler it had been brusquely
repulsed.</p>

<p>Money, with which Ronnie was once so lavish,
had now undoubtedly become scarce. When I asked
for my monthly allowance for wages and bazaar
I was put off with an impatient excuse. The mere
hint at the payment of bills appeared to exasperate
him, and so, for shame’s sake, I settled the smaller
accounts and servants’ wages out of my own pocket.
Hitherto I had shared expenses, contributing ten
pounds a month towards housekeeping, and this
I handed over intact to my brother. Shop bills,
bazaar bills, that I thought he had paid, now poured
in in shoals, and the club account was appalling.
A talk with Roger Arkwright made me even more
uneasy. He joined me one day as I rode back
from Secunderabad, and after a little commonplace
conversation began rather nervously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span></p>

<p>“I say, Miss Lingard, you will forgive me if I am
taking a most awful liberty&mdash;you know that Ronnie
and I are old friends and schoolfellows, and all that
sort of thing. Just lately I’m afraid he has got his
money affairs into a hopeless hash. He won’t listen to
a word I say, and though I don’t like doing it I
feel obliged to ask you to try to get him to take
a pull. He gambles.”</p>

<p>“Only at bridge&mdash;for small sums.”</p>

<p>“You can lose very heavily at bridge,” said
Roger gravely, “and also at poker. Ronnie plays
high at the club, and also down at Balthasar’s.”</p>

<p>“Balthasar’s!” I echoed in dismay.</p>

<p>“Yes, fellows drive down there, dine, and
play chemin de fer. On these occasions I’m afraid
Ronnie tells you that he’s on guard, or dining at some
mess. He is not our old Ronnie; no, he has come
under some bad influence this last year. Don’t you
notice how he has changed and aged, and that he’s not
half as cheery as he used to be? He has become so
terribly restless, and seems always in a condition of
feverish excitement. I believe he and that chap
Fox, of the Tea-Green Lancers, who has loads of coin,
cable home and back horses, and lately I fancy
they have both been rather badly hit.”</p>

<p>“This is terrible!” I gasped at last. “I knew
that Ronnie was short of money lately, and he
certainly does not look himself; but I never dreamt of
what you have just told me.”</p>

<p>“It’s partly the fault of Fox,” he replied, “who
eggs him on and has a bottomless purse. I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
there is a sort of rivalry between them. Ronnie has
always been so popular, with his polo and rackets,
quite a celebrity in his way, and inclined to be a bit
extravagant. Then he went home last year and,
apparently, got hold of a good sum of money. Well,
I’m afraid from all I hear that he has come to the
end of that now. The colonel has had hints of his
debts and I am told is rather uneasy in his mind,
and if something, or someone, does not interfere,
Ronnie will find himself in hot water. I believe he
has borrowed money from that fellow Balthasar.”</p>

<p>I felt so shaken that I could not speak&mdash;only
stare at my companion with what, no doubt, was a
face of horror.</p>

<p>“Always remember you can rely on me, Miss
Lingard,” continued Roger. “Whatever happens I
will stick by him&mdash;and here he is now,” as Ronnie
cantered up behind us with his pony in a lather.</p>

<p>“You look as if you’d come far and fast,” said
Roger, with a quick change of manner.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve just been down to Chudderghat,”
he answered, “something to do with the next
gymkhana on the Futeh Maidan.”</p>

<p>I felt positively certain that this was an untruth.
Ronnie had been down to interview Balthasar. As
I rode towards home I made no attempt to join in
the conversation. My mind was in a tumult. What
was I to say to Ronnie? How could I economise and
help him? I would send away the <i>dirzee</i> and one
of the table servants. I had nearly a thousand
rupees with Bunsi Lal the banker. I must speak to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
Ronnie about his affairs without delay, and was
screwing up my courage to the sticking-point&mdash;as
Ronnie was always so irritable whenever I mentioned
money. But as it happened I need not have troubled
myself, for as soon as Roger Arkwright had cantered
off towards his own quarters Ronnie turned and
attacked me.</p>

<p>“I know what’s coming!” and his face was
livid; “you and that fellow Arkwright have been
laying your heads together about <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind if we did?” I rejoined courageously&mdash;but
my voice was shaking.</p>

<p>“Yes I do. Now understand, I won’t have either
of you meddling in my affairs. What’s he been
saying?”</p>

<p>“That you gamble.”</p>

<p>“That I gamble,” mimicking my voice. “And
if I do?”</p>

<p>“He says you have lost a great deal of money;
that you go to Balthasar’s to play chemin de fer, and
are heavily in debt. Oh, Ronnie dear, don’t be so
hard and reserved, so unlike yourself with <i>me</i>,”
I pleaded. “I have money at the bank&mdash;do let me
help you! I shall sell Tommy Atkins and economise
in every possible way. Do take me into your confidence&mdash;for,
after all, there are only the two of us.”</p>

<p>“Well, since you put it like that, as the professor
used to say, I don’t mind telling you that I <i>do</i> owe
some thousands of rupees. Balthasar has got me out
of a pretty big hole, and I shall be able to settle
up everything before long and be clear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span></p>

<p>“Oh Ronnie&mdash;how splendid!” I exclaimed, now
inexpressibly relieved.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;if Collarette wins the Calcutta Cup; and
if not I shall pull through somehow. I cannot think
how my affairs are known; the morghi khana is a
hotbed of gossip&mdash;those women have tongues of fire.
The colonel was quite shirty with me yesterday about
my mess bill, and Mrs. Soames, who always takes her
cue from him, was as cool as ice when I met her at
the boat club. But don’t be uneasy, old girl,” he
concluded, as he assisted me to dismount. “I shall
go slow for a bit and it will all be as right as rain.”</p>

<p>But <i>I</i> was not so sure. I was sensible of gathering
clouds, and that very day I drew my balance from
the bank, cleared off the hateful bazaar bills and
wrote home for more money. Letters from Brian
were such a comfort now; they gave me great happiness
and support. He had written from Bombay,
Aden and Port Said. These epistles were not
long but they were most satisfactory, and written
in the clear deliberate hand that accorded with
himself.</p>

<p>For a week or two, so far as bills and money
troubles were concerned, there was a great calm. I
had not sold Tommy Atkins, and I rode, played
tennis, and went about as usual. I noticed, however,
that Mrs. Soames was by no means so intimate or
confidential as formerly. On the contrary, she had
adopted an attitude of freezing reticence. I think
she was painfully exercised in her mind. On the
one hand she saw her protégée the future Countess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
of Runnymede (a match that when made public
would glorify her as a chaperon), and on the other
was Ronnie, her former chief favourite, in deep
disgrace with her autocratic husband. Although
nothing serious had been said or done there was a
coolness; we were no longer invited to supper on
Sundays, and at an afternoon club dance Mrs. Soames
refused to honour Ronnie with her usual waltz!</p>

<p>During these socially grey days I received the
following letter from Mrs. Hayes-Billington. It was
written in a feeble and almost illegible hand:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Eva</span>,&mdash;I have to thank you for your
kind, cheerful little notes, but I am past cheering. I
seem to have arrived at the end of all things. My
health has been on the wane ever since I came to
this awful place, and I am glad to say that I shall
not be here long. As it is, hours seem endless. I
have no companions, nothing to do but lie and think;
I close my eyes and contemplate the days that are
no more, and the people to whom <i>I</i> am no more. I
live some happy scenes over and over again. Then
I open my eyes to find myself alone and dying, and
the worst of it is that I suppose I have deserved my
fate. I offended Mrs. Grundy and she has killed me!
Poor old Bertie, he will be sorry. I cannot tell you
how kind and unselfish he is, but he is obliged to
stick to his work, which claims his time like an insatiable
monster, and it is reported that the mine is not
paying. How I wish I could see your bright, happy
face once more! but I know that such a wish is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
folly. Good-bye, my dear girl, try and think of
me as kindly as you can. Bertie will write to you
when all is over.</p>

<p>
“D. B.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>I must confess that this letter made me shed tears.</p>

<p>After the scene with Balthasar, when he told me
of Mrs. Hayes-Billington’s loneliness and illness, I
had written to her pretty often, and sent her newspapers,
books and sweets&mdash;remembering how she
loved chocolate. I wondered what Brian would say
if he were to come in and find me weeping over a
letter from Mrs. Hayes-Billington. Perhaps Ronnie
was right, and Brian was a <i>little</i> bit straitlaced.</p>

<p>Another letter that I had recently received was of
much more cheerful character. It came from Lizzie
Puckle. She wrote to announce that she was about
to marry a Canadian engineer, and was sailing for
Montreal in a month’s time. I was delighted for
Lizzie’s sake that she, too, was about to flap her
wings and see the world&mdash;but sorry for myself.
Somehow Canada seemed so far away, and I felt as
if she were about to pass out of my life entirely.</p>

<hr class="tb"  />

<p>At last the sword that I half dreaded fell! The
beginning of the trouble was an order from headquarters
announcing that the regiment was not to
be relieved for twelve months. This was a blow
to some, a relief to others, and a surprise to all.
There was a hasty cancelling of sales and a general
readjustment of plans. I wrote the news home to
Brian and said: “As your father is so much better,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
I shall look forward to seeing you here very soon.”
I felt that in a crisis, or the storm that was approaching,
he would be my mainstay. I had always realised
that Brian was a strong man.</p>

<p>Immediately after the order respecting reliefs
was known, I was conscious of a still greater change
in Ronnie. Collarette had been ignominiously defeated;
this was a serious blow, and our financial
affairs were far from flourishing. I disposed of two of
my best scarcely known or worn frocks to the Greys,
dismissed the <i>mali</i>, and left off sugar and claret; but
to cope with our difficulties was beyond my powers.
Instinctively I grasped this truth, and my spirits,
once so high and exuberant, now fell to zero.</p>

<p>One Sunday night I noticed that Ronnie, who had
been out all day and returned an hour late for dinner,
was looking unusually haggard and dejected. He
scarcely uttered a word or ate a morsel, but swallowed
two very stiff pegs, and when the meal was over rose
and said abruptly:</p>

<p>“I have a lot of work to do, Sis; do not mind me
but go to bed, and on no account sit up.”</p>

<p>Obediently I retired into my room and put on a
dressing-gown, and as soon as the ayah had brushed
my hair dismissed her. There was not the slightest
use in attempting to go to bed, for I knew that I
could not sleep. I was oppressed with a premonition
of some imminent disaster; so acute
was this sensation, that it seemed as if the horror
were actually present in the bungalow. I tried to
read, but the attempt was a failure; then I got up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
crept into the dining-room. Ronnie’s office and
dressing-room opened out of it and I peeped in. He
was sitting with his back to me at a table, his head
resting on his hands; I wondered if he were asleep.
At any rate, he was totally unaware of my presence,
and I crept away as stealthily as a thief in the night.</p>

<p>In an hour’s time I returned, resolved to insist
upon his going to bed. On this occasion I made
no attempt at concealment, but boldly pushed back
the purdah till the rings jingled.</p>

<p>Ronnie heard my footfall on the matting, and
started. As he turned about, I felt my heart contract,
for I saw that his face had a ghastly, glazed appearance,
and that he held a revolver in his hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_21">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span>RONNIE’S CONFESSION</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">“Good God, Eva!”</span> exclaimed Ronnie. “What do
you mean by creeping on me like this?”</p>

<p>My answer was to throw myself with all my force
upon his wrist and wrench the revolver out of his
hand. He rose unsteadily, and stared at me. The
expression on his face was something inhuman and
terrible&mdash;and I could see that he was trembling
from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Give it here!” he commanded hoarsely.
“You <i>must</i>&mdash;and clear out&mdash;it will be all over in a
couple of minutes!”</p>

<p>I made no reply, but held the weapon behind
my back in a vice-like grip.</p>

<p>“Eva, do you hear me?&mdash;give it back,” he
reiterated, seizing my arm and shaking it violently.</p>

<p>“Hear <i>me</i> first,” I panted breathlessly. “Oh,
Ronnie, how can you think of doing such an awful
thing? Have you the heart to leave me out here all
alone to face&mdash;whatever you shrink from?”</p>

<p>His expression changed, the rigidity relaxed, and
he dropped my arm with a hasty gesture.</p>

<p>“Think, Ronnie, of death&mdash;and what it means.”</p>

<p>“My dear Eva, I have been thinking of nothing
else the last two hours. At seven-and-twenty there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
a big bit of life due, but I have no alternative. I’m
in a hideous fix, and there is only one way out.”</p>

<p>“There must be another,” I said; “this one is the
coward’s path. Oh, Ronnie, I implore you to take
me into your confidence. <i>What</i> has happened?”</p>

<p>“The family curse has overtaken me&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Gambling?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What’s bred in the bone there’s no getting
away from&mdash;it is part of oneself.”</p>

<p>“Two heads are better than one. It may be the
case of the mouse and the lion. Promise me that
you will put this idea out of your head. Listen.
I will make some hot coffee at the stove, and we will
go and sit out in the veranda and you shall tell me
<i>everything</i>. But before I leave you I must have
your promise,” and I looked him full in the eyes.</p>

<p>“All right,” he agreed. “I give you my word,
and you can go and make the coffee. You are a
level-headed girl, and perhaps you may be able to
see some glimmer of light in the darkness.”</p>

<p>I glanced fearfully round the room trying to discover
if there were any other weapon, then I went
back into my own apartment and hid the revolver;
returning, I lit the oil stove and prepared the coffee.
As soon as it was ready I brewed two large cups and
took one to Ronnie, who was standing by the table
in the dining-room.</p>

<p>“I feel better for that,” he said, “it clears my
head. The other thing would have cleared my head
too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” I expostulated. “How can you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span></p>

<p>“Come on, then. Shall we sit in the veranda?”</p>

<p>I rather shrank from this suggestion, remembering
my happy half-hour with Brian. That had been a
love tale; now I was probably about to listen to a
history containing the elements of life and death.</p>

<p>“No, let us go into the compound and walk up
and down&mdash;it is a lovely warm night.”</p>

<p>“Day,” he corrected. “In another half-hour
we shall see the dawn.”</p>

<p>We strolled to the gate in silence, and came
to a full stop. Kip, who had accompanied us, much
astonished at our proceedings, settled down on
the tail of my dressing-gown and curled himself up
for sleep.</p>

<p>“Well, Sis,” said Ronnie, drawing a long breath,
“I’ll tell you everything now. You and I have always
been such tremendous pals, that I suppose you think
you know me, but you’ve only seen my best side.
Even as a small boy I had a taste for gambling and
betting&mdash;if the stake was only a few coppers or
stamps. All the same, I did well at school and at
Sandhurst, where, as you know, I passed out first,
and got the sword. Before I was launched upon
my own, Uncle Horace gave me a tremendous
talking-to; told me our family history and warned
me that the vice of gambling was in the Lingard
blood. Cards were my father’s curse&mdash;betting is
mine! Even in my teens I followed racing with
the deepest interest, and could have passed a pretty
stiff examination in ‘Ruff’s Guide to the Turf.’
The first few years I spent out here I was just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
happy as a king. I was awfully keen and liked
the Service; I’d heaps of friends, four hundred a
year besides my pay, and I took to polo like a duck
to water. At gymkhanas and small race meetings
I was extraordinarily lucky, riding my own
ponies and winning all before me. Racing people
offered me mounts&mdash;you see I’m a light weight and
can ride&mdash;so I got mixed up with the turf and was
gradually sucked into the whirlpool. I backed
horses at Lucknow and Calcutta, and on the whole
did well. This regiment is not a racing one&mdash;they
go in for cricket and polo&mdash;but I found a kindred spirit
in Fox of the Tea-Green Lancers. He has tons of
money, is mad keen about racing, and we used to go
shares in cables and expenses&mdash;for we both backed
horses at home. Once I pulled off a double event
on the Lincolnshire and Grand National, and bought
new ponies, gave champagne dinners at the club,
and made a great splash. Well, I wasn’t long a
winner, but had some truly awful facers.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment and then continued:</p>

<p>“It was one of these facers that took me home
last year. I’d been nibbling at my capital for some
time, and, as I wanted to handle ready coin, I sold out
a lot of stock. Naturally I made the most of my
leave in England&mdash;at Ascot and Goodwood. Lately
my luck has been dead out, and yet, like all gamblers,
I have been fighting and striving like mad to get my
own back, and have gone in up to my neck!”</p>

<p>“Why did you not tell me? I might have helped
you,” I broke in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span></p>

<p>“No, no, Sis, you could not do anything. Balthasar
has given me a hand a couple of times; he is
a money-lender&mdash;under the rose&mdash;the financial pose
is all rot. He gives ripping dinners with top-hole
champagne&mdash;afterwards his guests play poker and
chemin de fer; it is all kept dark. He has, as I say,
helped me out once or twice, but somehow, since you
and he had that scrap I have a feeling that he is no
longer my jovial and open-handed ally, but as hard
as the Gun Rock!”</p>

<p>Here Ronnie came to a dead stop, and appeared
to be suddenly engrossed in his own sombre
reflections.</p>

<p>“But what is it <i>now</i>?” I ventured. “What has
brought your affairs to such a terrible crisis?”</p>

<p>“Crisis indeed!” he echoed, turning to face me,
and in the soft light of an Indian night I could see
that his face was convulsed with emotion. “Eva,
you will be horrified when I tell you that&mdash;I have
laid hands on the regimental funds!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ronnie!” I gasped.</p>

<p>“You may well say, ‘Oh, Ronnie!’ That’s the
awful part of the whole thing&mdash;my rage for gambling
goaded me to mad recklessness; that and the sudden
change in the reliefs have done for me.”</p>

<p>“But what have the reliefs to say to <i>you</i>?”
I stammered.</p>

<p>“You know we were all supposed to be going
home in February and everyone was selling off. We
sold our polo ponies for a long price, and the sum
was set aside for a team at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes&mdash;I know that.”</p>

<p>“The canteen fund was rich, and the colonel
was holding over a big surplus towards setting up
in our next station.”</p>

<p>“How could&mdash;&mdash;” I began.</p>

<p>“Just let me go on&mdash;you’ll soon understand,”
interrupted Ronnie. “The polo money was taken
over by Mills, our treasurer; he lodged it, in spite of the
colonel, in a bank. It’s in a way a private fund, and
the C.O. could not stop him. Mills is dead keen
about coin, being poor and thrifty; he said even for
six weeks four per cent. was worth having.”</p>

<p>I leant heavily against the gate. How much
longer would these details torture me?</p>

<p>“Mills and the colonel had a regular set-to over
the business; I heard them arguing in the anteroom.
The colonel is shy of local banks and temporary
investments&mdash;he was once badly hit up north&mdash;so
he insisted on keeping the canteen funds locked up
in the safe in the orderly room&mdash;and I stole them.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;stole&mdash;them!” I repeated in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes, but only under the most frightful pressure.
You see I knew all about this money. I have been
acting adjutant whilst Gloag got a month’s leave
to see his people in the Neilgherries. I counted over
the canteen notes, reported all correct, stuffed
them into a drawer in the safe, and never gave them
another thought till last week. Then the mail
brought me a letter from my London bookie, saying
that I must pay up my losses&mdash;about £400&mdash;or be
posted and run in. He gave me a fortnight’s grace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
I hadn’t a penny in the bank&mdash;in fact I’m overdrawn.
On the other hand, I had a splendid book on the
Calcutta races and was confident I’d get home on
Collarette. Meanwhile, I was at my wits’ end to
find the ready money for Hawkins. I knew if I
was posted that it meant ruin; then some little
black devil whispered: ‘What about that canteen
money? It won’t be wanted for a couple of months;
you can settle up with Hawkins, and the Calcutta
winnings will refund the loan. It would only be an
extra big risk and gamble.’ To make a long story
short, I took the coin; I told myself it was only a
loan, and everything combined to make the job
dead easy.”</p>

<p>Here Ronnie paused; his voice sounded husky,
as if his throat were dry. For my part, I could not
have spoken if my life had depended on it.</p>

<p>“For two or three days I struggled,” he went
on. “I am not a hardened scoundrel. I fought
off the temptation, but I was pinned fast between the
devil and the deep sea. If I did not pay my debts of
honour, I would be smashed; and if the canteen
money was suddenly missed and had not been
replaced, I was also smashed. At last I gave in.
Late one sultry afternoon, I happened to be alone
in the orderly room copying the summary of evidence
for a court martial; the head clerk had finished and
I had given him leave to depart. All the time my
pen was scratching along the paper it seemed to say,
‘Take it! take it! Here is your chance.’ You know
the orderly room is in the old barracks, where, by all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
accounts, queer things have happened. There was
something in the warm atmosphere that relaxed
my will. Although I saw nothing, I felt acutely
sensible of a dominating other-world presence between
me and the window. Eva, I’ll swear that
some sort of evil spirit was urging me to take my
chance and just <i>one</i> more risk!</p>

<p>“For a good while I hesitated. At last I got
up and closed the door into the clerks’ room, and when
I took the keys and opened the safe, I declare my
heart was thumping like a motor engine. The money
was in a small drawer; ten days before I had counted
over the notes and reported ‘all correct,’ and I knew
that a sum of seven thousand rupees was intact.
I drew out the dingy bundle, greasy and discoloured&mdash;but
good paper for all that&mdash;thrust it into my pocket,
and locked the safe. Once the deed was actually
accomplished, I felt relieved and even cheerful. Next
morning I gave the notes to Bunsi Lal’s agent, in
exchange for a cheque on London.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“So that load was off my back; and then I hedged
in case Collarette failed me, and wrote by the same
mail to Uncle Horace, begging him to lend me five
hundred pounds. I told him that it was a case of
the most terrible necessity, and implored him not to
fail me. I expect his answer in ten days&mdash;but by
then it’ll be too late. Collarette, as you know, ran
a cur; she shut up in the last fifty yards. Then
followed the bomb about our reliefs being cancelled.
Last, and worst of all, Mills came to me on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
Saturday and said: ‘That canteen money is going
to be invested after all; I’ve been telling the colonel
we may as well get some interest this next six months,
it is to be made over to Loughton and Law on deposit
receipt. I suppose they’ll give four per cent., so will
you let me have it, Ronnie, and I’ll fix it up? A bit
over seven thousand rupees, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>“I declare to you, Sis, that I felt as if the sky had
fallen in. That was Saturday, and here is Monday.
If I cannot put the money back in the safe&mdash;or
rather produce it and pretend I’ve taken it out&mdash;by
Wednesday morning, I’m done for. I shall be
convicted of making away with the regimental funds,
be tried by court martial and cashiered. <i>My</i> alternative
was better than that!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ronnie, Ronnie, don’t say it!” I protested
in agony.</p>

<p>“Just fancy my being proved to be a regular
‘budmash’ and thief&mdash;if I were out of it all things
would be hushed up. I’d just have been bundled
into a hole in the cemetery&mdash;and nothing <i>said</i>. I
know the colonel would move heaven and earth to
smother the scandal. He thinks so much of the
reputation of the regiment, and if one of his officers
were to be tried by court martial, and the case came
out in all the papers, it would turn his hair white.”</p>

<p>“And so you have only until the day after to-morrow,”
I faltered at last. “Something must be
done&mdash;can’t I cable and get out money?”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, “there would be no end of
formalities; anyway it would be too late. My one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
chance is <i>Balthasar</i>. I sounded him about a loan,
but I must confess that he was not responsive&mdash;even
though I talked of big interest. He is my only
hope. I clutch at him as my very last straw. He
said he might turn up here to-morrow afternoon,
and I believe if you were really most awfully nice to
him he would come to the rescue&mdash;it’s just my one
chance.”</p>

<p>I clenched my hands tightly on the top bar of
the gate; the prospect was too hideous. That I
should have to put forth my utmost efforts to cajole
and mollify my most detested acquaintance was,
indeed, an overwhelming enterprise&mdash;and yet, looking
over the whole situation, it seemed to me that in
Balthasar’s assistance lay our only road of escape.</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” I murmured at last.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you will do <i>that</i>, you will certainly pull me
through. I know you dislike him and I hate asking
you to influence him, but you see my position is
desperate. Perhaps you might bring a little light
into the darkness; and there,” he said, pointing, “the
light is coming. I see the pale dawn beginning to
creep along the horizon&mdash;I shall accept it as a good
omen. And now, my dear sister, I will turn in and get
some sleep. I have not closed my eyes for three whole
nights. I shall want to have all my wits about me
when Balthasar appears, though it is <i>you</i> who will
deal with him.” So saying he kissed my bare arm
and strode off towards the bungalow.</p>

<p>But I still remained leaning over the gate, trying
to face things and to realise the situation. I seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
to take no count of time; I felt as if I had been
turned into a block of stone. If Ronnie could get
the loan and pay the canteen money he would be
relieved from an awful situation, though, from what
I could gather, he would be obliged to leave the
“Lighthearts.” (It was not a regiment in which
a captain could exist upon his pay.) I would stay
with him as long as possible, and see him through
his trouble. He would probably exchange into the
Indian Service and I would return home. That was
the best side. On the other&mdash;the worst&mdash;supposing
that Balthasar still remained hard as a stone?
Ronnie would be tried by court martial and disgraced.
I too would be disgraced and ruined socially.
As for Brian Falkland, how could he marry a
girl whose brother had been convicted of stealing?
There must be an end to that, and I buried my face
in my hands and rested my head upon the top bar
of the gate. I believe I remained in this position
for a long time, but at last I was disturbed by the
ducks. They had disposed of their breakfast and
were now quacking and waddling all round me,
urgent that I should bestir myself and suffer them
to pass forth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_22">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span>PUNISHMENT</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I leant against the gate, with my head resting
upon my arms, I felt bowed to the earth with abject
misery and quaking fear. It was as if an impenetrable
black cloud had suddenly descended on my life,
and blotted out every gleam of hope and happiness.
From this sort of hideous nightmare I was aroused
not only by the ducks but also by a bugle call; the
early-rising world of India would soon be afoot, and I
wrenched myself back into the present actual moment
and turned towards the bungalow, which faced a
by-road. No one had noticed me so far, beyond a
few passing market coolies and the <i>tannyketch</i>, whose
affair it was to provide for the poultry.</p>

<p>As soon as I had entered my room I removed the
revolver from its temporary hiding-place, and buried
it in a large tub of hydrangeas that stood outside
my door; then I threw off my dressing-gown and
scrambled into bed. I usually <a name="rose" id="rose"></a><ins title="Original has ‘rode’">rose</ins> early, and too
soon Mary ayah would appear, bringing me tea and
toast. Already I heard her anklets jingling, and
feigned sleep. I endeavoured to make the pretence
real, as a strenuous day and a dreadful ordeal lay
before me, but I found it impossible to rest. My
head seemed to throb and burn; I imagined I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
feel it thumping on the pillow, and no wonder! My
brain was racked in torture, striving to find some
clear, straight road out of our difficulties&mdash;for Ronnie’s
difficulties were mine. I lay thinking hard for nearly
an hour, and then rose and felt considerably refreshed
after my bath and breakfast. Ronnie had sent me a
little note to say, “I expect to be on the ranges
till four o’clock. <i>He</i> will be here about three.”</p>

<p>Evidently I would have to meet Balthasar alone.
Perhaps after all it would be best. I spent the
morning in making out a list of the contents of the
bungalow in a long narrow bazaar book supplied
by the cook. Pencil in hand, I carefully counted up
our glass and china, our pictures, ornaments, furniture&mdash;even
the very ducks&mdash;and in short everything
available for “a sale,” for, of course, if Ronnie were
now penniless, we must speedily shift our quarters.</p>

<p>All this business occupied my mind and kept
me from thinking, yet now and then I was seized
by a horrible sort of mental nausea. How was I to
beg from Balthasar&mdash;to implore, to abase myself&mdash;and
to succeed? As the dreadful hour approached
my heart beat fast. Oh, how much I would have
preferred to be about to face a surgical operation!
However, I made a great effort to prepare for the
ordeal and to look my best. I waved and re-dressed
my hair, and selected a pretty pale blue summer
muslin over silk far too smart for the occasion, but
I knew it was becoming. As I looked in the glass
I saw that my cheeks were unusually pink, my
eyes unusually bright. Outwardly all was well;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
inwardly I was on the verge of a terrible outburst
of tears, and tears were the last thing I must yield
to, that was certain! Balthasar was not the sort of
man who would be touched by these. I started
violently as I heard the hoot of a motor, and rushed
to my little medicine chest and fortified myself
with a dose of sal volatile&mdash;a detestable expedient,
but it might give me composure and courage&mdash;how
badly I needed both!</p>

<p>When I entered the drawing-room our visitor was
already in the veranda, and as he strutted in I instantly
realised that here was the Balthasar of Silliram&mdash;truculent,
overbearing and hateful.</p>

<p>“Is your brother here?” he asked, after our
first greeting, rolling his eyes all over the room in
search, no doubt, of Ronnie.</p>

<p>“No, he has been on the ranges all day,” I
replied, “but I expect him home shortly.”</p>

<p>“He asked me to come and see him on most
particular business.” Balthasar spoke with an injured
air as he sat down and carefully hitched up the
knees of his trousers. “Well, this is a nice affair,”
he continued, “your brother has no doubt told you
that he has been playing the very devil?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid he has been imprudent,” I murmured.</p>

<p>“You call it imprudent?” raising his voice.
“Well, I call it by another name, and the fine young
gentleman wants me to lend a hand with a big
cheque in it to pull him out of a hole.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you are kinder than you make your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>self
out to be, Mr. Balthasar. Can you not help
him?” I ventured timidly.</p>

<p>“No; why should I?” knitting his black brows.
“He would go ahead and back horses. What a
young fool! Only for me he would have been in
big trouble before this. I have lent money&mdash;certainly
it has been repaid&mdash;but then there was the
risk. No, no; I can do no more.”</p>

<p>“Then in that case, why did you come?” I
asked with a touch of temper. “I believe Ronnie
was trusting to you for assistance.”</p>

<p>He looked momentarily taken aback and then
replied in his slow drawl:</p>

<p>“I came just to see how he was going to work
his head out of the noose, and also because it gave
me a chance of meeting <i>you</i>, which is always such a
pleasure.”</p>

<p>“You say that you have lent Ronnie money
before and been repaid. Can you not do so again?
I believe you are a very rich man, Mr. Balthasar,
and a sum that would be salvation to Ronnie is a
mere trifle to you.”</p>

<p>“Where is my security?” he demanded sharply.</p>

<p>“I can give security. I have money in England.
See,” I said, rising and going to the table; “here
is a letter I have written to my bankers, asking
them to sell out stock, and remit the amount
to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh! Then you are of age?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was twenty-one a week ago.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I should not take you for more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
eighteen.” And he stared at me with a solemn air
of deliberate speculation. “Your fair hair and skin
belong to the <i>teens</i>.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you lend Ronnie the money now?” I
pleaded, anxious to divert the conversation from my
personal appearance, “and I will repay you, as you
can see, at once. You may, if you please, cable to
my bankers, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How much do you want?” he interrupted
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Four hundred pounds.”</p>

<p>“And when?”</p>

<p>“To-night&mdash;to-morrow it may be too late.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” And he gave a horrible sort of chuckle.
“Then matters are serious.” He sat for a moment
contemplating his neat patent leather shoes. At last
he said:</p>

<p>“Well, supposing I do advance this will you give
me a formal paper, stamped and witnessed?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” I answered eagerly, “and be
most grateful to you for your kindness.”</p>

<p>“Grateful!” he repeated, with cynical insolence.
“My dear young lady, gratitude is of no value in
business&mdash;but I’ll give the cheque.”</p>

<p>“Not a cheque, if you please, but money; notes
will be best.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he agreed, “you shall have the
money in notes. I will send it up to-night by ten
o’clock, in charge of a special messenger.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you&mdash;how good of you!”
I began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span></p>

<p>But again he interrupted me with a wave of his
beautifully manicured hand:</p>

<p>“Besides a speedy return of this large sum I must
call upon you for something extra in the way of&mdash;shall
we say&mdash;interest? No, not money, but&mdash;er&mdash;consideration
and appreciation. You have always
held me off; can I ever forget my dance with
you at the Residency ball, or the memory of what
happened in this very room?”</p>

<p>Something in the tone of his voice and the peculiar
expression of his eyes frightened me. My hands were
locked in my lap that he might not see how they were
shaking.</p>

<p>“Do please forgive me,” I pleaded tremulously.
“I was a proud child with a fiery temper, and I’m
afraid I cannot always control myself.”</p>

<p>“You have openly snubbed me, my beautiful
young lady, and to tell me you have a temper and
are sorry is of no use. You must be prepared to pay
me in my own coin.”</p>

<p>I waited in agony to hear my sentence.</p>

<p>“Oh, you need not go so white,” suddenly leaning
over and stroking my cheek; “I prefer the pretty
roses.” As I recoiled he added, “And the payment
I require is a mere nothing. In the eyes of
the whole station you have always scorned me in
your cool, haughty English manner. Now, you shall
appear in public as my dear friend, make what is
called ‘a demonstration,’ and let all the world see
that we are on the very best of terms. My new
motor is here. Go and put on your smartest hat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
and come with me, and show yourself in my company.
First of all, we will drive up to the polo at
Bolarum. There is a big match to-day&mdash;the Hussars
and the city team. From there we will run down
to the Hussain Saugur and look on at a boat race.
Afterwards we will go to the club and have a nice
little tea together, and then I will bring you home.
How do you like the programme?” His interrogative
grin was frankly diabolical.</p>

<p>How could I like the programme? I was aware
that to be seen in Balthasar’s great grey motor
would, so far as the world was concerned, cast me
socially into outer darkness. Everyone would believe
that we were engaged. This motor drive round
Secunderabad and its principal resorts would amount
to the precise equivalent of an announcement in the
London <i>Morning Post</i>. My heart sank. I was painfully
alive to the effect of this ostentatious tour, and
realised my hateful fate. I was the slave who was
about to be dragged at the conqueror’s chariot wheels;
nevertheless, I resolved to make the sacrifice for
Ronnie. After all, it would not be of such deadly consequence,
since he and I would soon disappear from the
station. As I rose to get ready my companion said:</p>

<p>“If you will draw up your acknowledgment
of the money and receipt now, I can take it with
me. It is merely a form, and I’ll send up a trusty
messenger to-night.”</p>

<p>Strange to say, some lingering sense of prudence
compelled me to reply, “I will have it all quite
ready when your messenger comes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span></p>

<p>“How suspicious we are!” he exclaimed with
a shrug. “Well, run along, my beautiful young lady,
and put on your best hat&mdash;the one with the white
feathers; it looks so nice and honeymoony. Ha!
ha! ha!”</p>

<p>I believe our retinue could scarcely believe their
eyes, when they beheld me come forth and, though
every fibre in my being rebelled against the situation,
take my place beside Balthasar sahib in his great grey
car. Soon we were gliding towards the R.A. lines
and away to the polo ground. I met, alas! many
of my acquaintances; there were the Greys and their
father, General and Mrs. Graham and Major and
Mrs. Mills&mdash;riding. Their stares of incredulity were
as so many stabs. At the polo other people also
gazed&mdash;my friends with amazement and it seemed
to me a sort of incredulous horror. One or two
men strolled over, and accosted me, and talked
perfunctorily of the game and the weather. I
believe they really came to see if they could believe
their senses, or if it was somebody faintly resembling
me who was sitting there beside Balthasar. My
hateful companion discoursed in a loud, guttural
voice; bragged of his new car and its cost, and
said that “with a little practice, a lady,” here
he nodded familiarly at me, “would <i>soon</i> learn to
drive it.”</p>

<p>I was too paralysed to repudiate the suggestion,
but my face probably spoke volumes. In Balthasar’s
car I could sympathise but too acutely with the
sensations of a rabbit in a snake house! Presently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
when all the world and his wife had enjoyed every
opportunity of beholding me, we went away at
great speed down to the boathouse, where I was
once more placed on show! Finally we drove to
the club, and there, in the most conspicuous place
that he could select, Balthasar and I had tea. Every
eye was upon us, and as he kept muttering: “Talk,
talk, talk; try and look as if you were enjoying
yourself! If you don’t play the game and do <i>your</i>
share, you can’t expect <i>me</i> to do mine,” I was compelled
to chatter any nonsense that my dazed brain
could invent, whilst he lolled in a chair, enacting the
part of a complacent and well-entertained potentate.
People who knew me well nodded, but no
one approached, except good kind Mrs. Lakin, who
came over to where we were seated, and said:</p>

<p>“I am going up to Trimulgherry, my dear”
(which remark was a most barefaced untruth, as her
home was in the opposite direction), “and I can give
you a lift, so that you won’t be taking Mr. Balthasar
out of his way, and there is a little matter I want
to consult you about.”</p>

<p>“It is too good of you, my dear madam,”
replied my companion in his most unctuous voice,
“but Miss Lingard is in my charge. She <i>loves</i> motoring,
and I am sure you would not wish to cut short
her pleasure.”</p>

<p>Vanquished Mrs. Lakin, with a sympathetic glance
at me, withdrew in helpless silence, and was presently
lumbering out of the compound in her dilapidated
victoria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span></p>

<p>By and by, when the club had scattered to bridge,
billiards, or the library, I was relieved from my rack
and carried back to the cantonment. As I stepped
out of the car I said, in a tone of humble apology:</p>

<p>“I know I’ve not been good company, but I am
sure you must realise that I am most dreadfully unhappy
about my brother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course,” he assented; “he is an
infernal young ass.”</p>

<p>“And you will keep your promise,” I added,
resting my hand on the car; “we may rely on
you? You <i>will</i> send it by messenger as soon as
possible?”</p>

<p>“Of course, you may rely on me,” he answered
impatiently; “my clerk will be with you at ten
o’clock to-night. I’ll see you again before long,”
and he signed to the chauffeur to proceed.</p>

<p>After this agonising experience I felt mentally
prostrated, and sank exhausted into a long chair in
the veranda. Ronnie, now at home, came quickly
forward, and when I said “It is all right,” the
relief in the expression of his drawn, worn face was
some recompense to me.</p>

<p>After dinner we sat out in the compound, watched
the dancing fireflies and listened to the distant band,
for it was “guest night” at the mess.</p>

<p>“He said the clerk would be here at ten o’clock.”
I repeated this more than once&mdash;the announcement
seemed to give me confidence. “It will be all in
notes,” I added.</p>

<p>“So much the better,” said Ronnie. “In fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
nothing else would do. I’ll take it up early to-morrow,
get hold of the key, stick it into the safe,
and hand it over to the old man. Oh, <i>what</i> a load
off my mind!”</p>

<p>Ten o’clock struck and we listened intently; in
the still Indian night there were no sounds but the
distant barking of a dog, the stamping of a pony
in the stable and the thrumming of tom-toms in the
Trimulgherry bazaar. Eleven o’clock&mdash;oh that agonised hour
of long-drawn suspense! At last a <i>gurra</i>
sounded twelve distinct strokes.</p>

<p>“Eva,” said Ronnie, suddenly breaking our
poignant silence, “that black-hearted devil has
played <i>you</i> false, and ruined <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Don’t give up yet,” I said, “as soon as
it’s light take my receipt and Tommy and gallop
down to Chudderghat and fetch the money yourself.”</p>

<p>“Right O!” he agreed eagerly. “Yes, it’s our
one chance. I shall have to be back before orderly-room,
which is at eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>Long before eight o’clock Ronnie had returned,
and I knew at once that the worst had happened!
With a ghastly, rigid face he staggered into the
veranda, as Tommy Atkins, dripping with sweat,
was led away.</p>

<p>“The whole thing was a fraud&mdash;a devilish fraud!”
said Ronnie, as he leant against a pillar and mopped
his face. “Balthasar was not there. He left the
station last night, and no one knows where he has
gone or when he will return. He always had his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
knife into you, Eva, ever since the day you turned
him out. Get me a peg; I must try and pull myself
together before I go to the orderly-room and face
the music. Hallo, here is Gloag!” he exclaimed, and
to my astonishment Captain Gloag rode into the
compound. He pulled up at the steps, threw the
reins to a syce, and clanked into the drawing-room,
where we followed him in silence.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Lingard,” he said, looking
more wooden-faced than ever. “Good morning,
Lingard. Ahem&mdash;I’ve come on a rather unpleasant
duty. Your presence is required in the orderly-room.
The colonel has told me to receive your sword, and to
place you under close arrest.”</p>

<p>With a face as wooden as the adjutant’s, and
without a word, Ronnie went inside in search of
his sword, and Captain Gloag turned to me and
said:</p>

<p>“This is pretty awful for you, Miss Lingard.
There has been some sort of mystery about the
canteen funds, so the safe in the orderly-room was
opened this morning&mdash;the drawer and the partition
in which Lingard was understood to keep the notes
was found empty. The safe has two keys; he had
one when acting adjutant. Of course he <i>may</i> be able
to explain all this, but the colonel is in a terrible
state&mdash;regimental funds should never be removed.”</p>

<p>Here Ronnie appeared with his sword and handed
it over in silence.</p>

<p>“Better start at once,” said the adjutant. “Will
you send for your pony?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span></p>

<p>Ronnie gave the order, but otherwise remained
dumb, and in less than five minutes I saw him
ride away with Captain Gloag, who carried his
sword in the sight of all spectators&mdash;our servants,
and the Millses’ servants&mdash;every one of whom realised
what this portended as well as I did myself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_23">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span>A HAVEN</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the departure of Ronnie I sat as if stunned;
possibly I could not have felt more utterly wretched
had he been dead. Indeed, it almost seemed to me
as if there were an element of death in the bungalow,
such was the silence. Not a sound to be heard,
except the dripping of a tap and a casual lizard
pattering on the matting; all the servants (and
other people’s servants) were collected in our cookhouse,
discussing the catastrophe. As a rule the
usual daily routine is carried on, no matter what
trouble overtakes a household, and presently I saw
the butler preparing breakfast in the dining-room.
Then he came to the door, salaamed with both
hands, and said:</p>

<p>“Please, missie, to come and take something.
Last night missie no dinner having; missie will be
sick, and that plenty bad business for everyone.”</p>

<p>This was true. If I were to collapse I would be
of no use, nor able to face the struggle and strain
which lay before me. I accepted the kind advice of
Michael, ate a little breakfast and felt better. If
Ronnie was about to fall into this awful trouble, I
must consider how I could best assist him. I had
already written home for money; I would arrange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
for the sale of everything, and if the worst came to
the worst, we should have to go away somewhere
together and hide our heads until the first fury of
the storm had abated.</p>

<p>It was now ten o’clock, and Ronnie had not yet
returned. As I was pacing up and down the
veranda, a prey to misery and impatience, I heard
a light step in the drawing-room, and there was Mrs.
Mills. Without a word she took me in her arms
and kissed me, and I could see that she had been
crying.</p>

<p>“My poor dear child,” she sobbed, “I have heard
all. George has just returned from the orderly-room,
and we want to know what we can do to
help you. We are so desperately sorry for you. So
is everyone.”</p>

<p>“You must not be too hard on Ronnie,” I protested,
“but a little sorry for him too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she said; “we all liked him so much,
and were so proud of him too. It’s that dreadful
gambling&mdash;he’s not the first young man that it has
ruined.”</p>

<p>“Ruined!” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, “at least in a way. The
canteen money is gone and he can offer no explanation.
The colonel is nearly beside himself,
and your brother will have to stand a general
court martial. Meanwhile he is to be confined to
his quarters in close arrest. There will be an
officer in charge of him and a sentry on duty, day
and night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span></p>

<p>I attempted to speak, but my voice completely
failed me.</p>

<p>“Under these circumstances, dear, you cannot
remain here. These are the colonel’s instructions, and
George and I wish you to come to us at once.”</p>

<p>“You are most awfully kind,” I replied, “and of
course I will not remain if it is irregular, but before
I do anything I should like to have a talk with
Ronnie.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I expect he will be back directly. Do
tell your ayah to pack up your things. George says
you are to have his room; he will move into a tent
in the compound.”</p>

<p>“You are more than good, dear Mrs. Mills, and
I will let you know my plans. Here comes Ronnie,”
I exclaimed, as he and one of his brother officers
entered the veranda together. Mrs. Mills hastily
disappeared over the wall into her own premises,
and as I could not face Ronnie’s companion in my
present state of mind I withdrew towards my room
and beckoned to my brother to follow me.</p>

<p>“Can I speak to my sister for a moment, Carr?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, by all means,” replied Mr. Carr, who
I must confess looked excessively uncomfortable&mdash;yes,
and miserable.</p>

<p>Ronnie then led the way into his den and drew
the purdah, but no one could overhear us, as the little
room was entirely cut off from the veranda. I sat
down and waited for him to speak. As he leant against
the wall he looked almost death-like. The wear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
and tear of the last few months had entirely dimmed
his good looks; his eyes were sunken, and there were
great hollows in his cheeks.</p>

<p>“I went up there,” he began in a husky voice,
“and found that <i>everything</i> was known. The
colonel ordered me to explain, but if I had been
shot I couldn’t have uttered a word! How could I
describe the frightful temptation that overpowered
me when I fingered that roll of greasy notes and
firmly believed that I’d be the winner of more than
double the money before they could be missed? If I
had been posted at home&mdash;just think of it, and uncle’s
feelings&mdash;I should have been obliged to leave my
London club, not to speak of the regiment; so, as you
know, I took the bull by the horns, grabbed the
coin and gave the notes to Bunsi Lal in exchange
for a cheque on London; then, by infernal bad luck
it appears that one of these notes was passed in
the bazaar&mdash;a thousand rupee note which was
peculiarly marked. Fryer the paymaster spotted it,
and smelt a thousand rats, and no doubt he gave
the C.O. a hint, hence these&mdash;er&mdash;tears. I wrote the
whole story home to uncle. His answer is due in ten
days. Whatever it may be, it comes too late now.
Well, in the orderly-room I made no defence; just
stood there tongue-tied. At the court martial, of
course, I’ll have an advocate&mdash;but all the same I’m
bound to get the boot! The colonel is beside himself&mdash;in
a stone-cold rage&mdash;for it seems that no officer of the
‘Lighthearts’ has ever before been court-martialled.”</p>

<p>I nodded my head, and Ronnie continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span></p>

<p>“Carr or another will be on duty, and so you
must turn out, as <i>you</i> are not under close arrest; and
I hope you will get away from the regimental lines.
It will be rather awkward for everyone if you are
hereabouts, though I know that the Millses wish to
take you in.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “Mrs. Mills has been here.”</p>

<p>“You must go to someone outside the regiment,
to the Greys, the Babingtons or the Campbells, to
await the finding of the court martial, and then you
and I will clear out. I say, I wonder how Falkland
will take it?”</p>

<p>To this I made no reply&mdash;the thought of Brian
was agonising.</p>

<p>“If I know him&mdash;and yet I don’t know him&mdash;I
believe this business will make no difference. If I
were a thief&mdash;well I <i>am</i> a thief&mdash;let’s say a murderer,
I believe he would stick to you all the same&mdash;he is
that sort.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” I murmured tremulously.</p>

<p>“Yes, sure, and now to business. I’ll get Arkwright
to sell the stable, Cursetjee is to take the
auction. I know you’ve made an inventory, and
that thanks to you we have no small bills. If you
happen to have any money, you might give it to
Michael to run the house, as I shall always have
a fellow here on duty. I understand that they will
do their best to assemble a court martial soon, but a
general court martial with a brigadier as president
takes time&mdash;at the earliest it will be three weeks.”</p>

<p>“How dreadful!” I exclaimed. “What ages to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
wait in suspense. Do you suppose you will be what
is called&mdash;cashiered?”</p>

<p>“Bound to,” he answered curtly.</p>

<p>After a moment I said:</p>

<p>“I have a hundred rupees I will give to Michael,
for which he will account to you. I suppose I shall
be allowed to come and see you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “and you had better come
after dark.”</p>

<p>“Well, whatever happens, Ronnie, remember that
<i>I</i> shall stick to you through thick and thin.”</p>

<p>“Then if you do, you will be an awful fool! I
shall only drag you down. When this business is
over, I’ll go to the colonies or South America, and
you must return home and marry Falkland.”</p>

<p>At this moment the ayah pulled back the curtain.
She had a chit in her hand.</p>

<p>“For missie,” she said, coming forward. I
opened the note; it was from Mrs. Lakin, and ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Girl</span>,&mdash;I have heard of your great trouble,
and am so sorry for you both. You must come to me
to-day. I shall fetch you about three o’clock, and
bring a cart for your luggage. Down here at Begumpett
we are out of the world, and you can just be as
quiet as you please. There are only my husband
and myself. We are, as you know, neither young
nor smart, only dull and old-fashioned, but we’ll
do our best to take care of you and will look upon
you as one of our own girls.&mdash;Yours in affectionate
sympathy,</p>

<p>
“<span class="smcap">Lucinda J. Lakin</span>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the place for you!” said Ronnie, who
had been reading the note over my shoulder, “she’s
a rare good sort, and you’ll be out of the way of
prying eyes and the talk. Lord! <i>how</i> people will talk!
Old Mother Lakin is one of the best. You can get
her to bring you up and see me of an evening. And
now I must go back to Carr; he is bound to be starving
for his breakfast. He or another officer will have
this room, so tell your old ayah to hurry up and
pack. Well, Eva,” and his voice shook, as he put
his hand suddenly on my shoulder and looked me
straight in the face, “I must say this is beastly hard
on <i>you</i>.” Then he kissed me with burning hot
lips, and swung back into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>In order to prepare for Ronnie’s guard, Mary ayah
and I worked vigorously for hours, and put together
and packed my multitude of belongings. This task
accomplished, I interviewed Michael and the cook,
wrote business letters to Cursetjee and Spencer, and
when Mrs. Lakin called she found me ready to
accompany her. As we drove out of the compound
I turned to look back on the bungalow with its
cork tree avenue and veranda veiled in creepers, for
three months the abode of happiness, and the theatre
of so many experiences: the scenes with Balthasar,
with Brian, and with Ronnie.</p>

<p>Kind Mrs. Lakin did not attempt to make conversation
as we rolled along side by side behind a
shabby coachman and an ancient screw, but from
time to time she pressed my hand with silent and
comforting sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span></p>

<p>On the steps of his house Colonel Lakin received
me as if nothing particular had happened and I
was a visitor whom he delighted to honour. My
room was prepared, and oh, how comfortable! Such
large down pillows, such deep roomy chairs and a
delightful sofa. Most of the furniture, I subsequently
learned, had been bought from Deschamps in Madras,
when Colonel and Mrs. Lakin started housekeeping,
and since then had travelled hundreds&mdash;I may say
thousands&mdash;of miles over the Madras Presidency.
On this inviting couch I lay down to rest, worn out
between emotion and the loss of sleep. Dusk had
come and I must have enjoyed more than the
traditional forty winks, when the ayah announced:</p>

<p>“Mem sahib Soames.”</p>

<p>The heavy chick was thrust aside and Mrs. Soames
entered without apology. The moment I saw her I
sprang up.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” she began, “I simply <i>had</i> to
come and see you.” She put her arms round my neck
and kissed me. “I am just heart-broken, though,
after all, what am I to you?”</p>

<p>We sat down together on the sofa, and she held
my hand in hers.</p>

<p>“Ronnie must have been mad, poor boy; but
gambling is like a disease, it is in the blood. My
grandfather had it, and only for the mercy of my
mother’s fortune we would certainly have all been
in the workhouse. Ronnie is the last young man
I’d have dreamt of getting into such trouble. I
would have fetched you the moment I heard of&mdash;&mdash;”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
and she stammered “of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;” then wisely abandoned
the detail. “James, although he likes you immensely,
said it would be better if you were not in
our lines. You could not help seeing and hearing
things that might jar and pain you. So dear Mrs.
Lakin is quite the right person to receive you, but
Eva&mdash;you believe, don’t you, that I am always your
sincere and loving friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “I am quite sure of that.”</p>

<p>“James is frantic,” she resumed. “I have never
seen him in such a condition; he cannot eat, he cannot
rest, he paces up and down the dining-room like
some caged animal. There has never been a scandal
or a court martial in the regiment&mdash;at least, not
within the memory of man&mdash;and he takes this affair
most fearfully to heart. He says it will be in all the
papers at home, and that if he had done the deed
himself he could not feel the disgrace more acutely.
Oh, if I had only known that your brother wanted a
loan I’d have lent him the money without hesitation.
He was always one of my best boys&mdash;and I do try
to help them. If he had just given me one little
hint&mdash;and you, my dear?” turning to me.</p>

<p>“I knew nothing, dreamt of nothing, till the night
before last, when I found Ronnie with a revolver in
his hand.” Here I broke down and sobbed in her
arms.</p>

<p>When I had somewhat recovered and was able to
speak more coherently, I told my friend the story
of Balthasar’s revenge and perfidy.</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor, poor darling!” she cried. “How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
dared he? I heard that you had been seen with
him in his car, but did not believe it; and so you
sacrificed yourself to Balthasar’s vanity and malice,
and all for nothing. Well now,” drying her own tears,
“I shall come and see you again, of course, and we
will lay our heads together and make plans. If there
is anyone I can write to, any possible thing that I
can do, you have only to send me a line by one of
Mrs. Lakin’s chuprassies. Now I am afraid, dear, it
is getting late and I must go.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mills, Zora, the Greys, and various other
friends came to see me. Their visits were most
kindly meant, but undeniably painful for them and
for me. It was not as if I had lost Ronnie by death;
I had been separated from him by disgrace, and their
condolences were vague and embarrassing.</p>

<p>How I longed to hide myself and be alone, although
Mrs. Lakin’s company was never unwelcome.
Her large heart overflowed with tactful human
kindness, and I was treated as something between a
spoilt child and a pampered invalid, and oh, the
solid comfort of her ménage! What well-oiled wheels
in all departments; what soft-footed servants, what
cream, eggs, and butter (Mrs. Lakin had her own
cows and poultry); but in these days I could not
eat, and supported existence on tea and toast.</p>

<p>Every evening about sundown my friend took me
for long drives into the country; the boulder-strewn
plains looked soft and beautiful in the moonlight,
and as we bowled along behind the old chestnut&mdash;a
surprisingly free goer&mdash;she told me tales of former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
days, on purpose, no doubt, to keep my thoughts
from dwelling&mdash;as they did&mdash;on the one subject.
She also related the history of scandals, social
convulsions, courts martial and civil trials, beside
which Ronnie’s iniquities were pale and insignificant.
The kind woman exerted herself in this manner in
order to cheer me and give my future a less hopeless
outlook.</p>

<p>Colonel Lakin was also active on my behalf. He
got rid of our ponies and cart, Ronnie’s guns and
saddlery, all for a good price; and Zora’s eldest
brother bought my dear Tommy Atkins and promised
him a happy home.</p>

<p>On several occasions I had visited Ronnie, and
found him more like his normal self and less depressed.</p>

<p>“Now that I have no anxieties and nothing to
<i>hide</i>, I feel better and I can sleep,” he announced.
“Arkwright tells me that I have a capital chap as
my advocate, and I must say the fellows in the
regiment have been extraordinarily forbearing and
staunch. Grimes sends down the papers, Waller
brought me a box of the best Havana cigars, and I
go for a drive every evening when there’s no one about.
The one thing that I cannot stand is the sentry always
in evidence. I believe the court martial will soon
assemble now. They are bringing members from
Bellary, Poona and Bangalore, and I don’t suppose
it will last longer than a couple of days. Is it not
extraordinary that I’ve had neither letter nor cheque
from Uncle Horace?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span></p>

<p>“Not when you remember that all his correspondence
is overlooked by Aunt Mina.”</p>

<p>“And she always pretended to be so fond of me&mdash;and
now, as far as she is concerned, I may drop
into the pit.”</p>

<p>“Well, you and I will drop down together,” I
declared. “Keep up your heart&mdash;they say the troubles
we most fear are those that never happen.”</p>

<p>Alas, the dreaded event arrived only too soon.
I heard of the date from my kind friend Colonel
Lakin. The members assembled, and sat in the
regimental ante-room. On the first day the business
was chiefly technical and formal; the second held
Ronnie’s fate, and it seemed to me to be as long
as an average week. I had declined to go for my
usual evening drive, but waited within doors for the
return of Colonel Lakin, who would bring us the result
of the finding.</p>

<p>It was late when he returned to Begumpett
and the wheels of his dog-cart rumbled under the
lofty porch. Mrs. Lakin was awaiting him in the
veranda, but I was too anxious and shaken to venture
beyond my room. In a condition of breathless
tension I heard him enter the drawing-room and
exchange a few words with his wife. Rooms in the
Madras Presidency are merely separated by thick
curtains, with a wide space open at the top, and as
I overheard her sharp exclamation I was a little
prepared when she came to me with a troubled face
and said:</p>

<p>“Dear child, I don’t know <i>how</i> I am to tell you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
but they have found your brother guilty of the
misappropriation of regimental funds&mdash;&mdash;” She
paused, and the tears ran down her cheeks as she
added in a broken voice: “They have given him
two years’ imprisonment.”</p>

<p>As soon as I had grasped the real meaning of this
speech I seemed to feel as if I were crumbling to
pieces, and sank on the ground in a dead faint.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_24">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span>THE FLIGHT</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a special favour I was granted permission to have
an interview with Ronnie before he was removed,
not to “Windsor Castle,” as Secunderabad jail was
nicknamed&mdash;for the regiment had protested&mdash;but to
Bangalore, a second-class establishment.</p>

<p>“I wish to goodness they were going to <i>hang</i>
me!” was the first thing Ronnie said, and there
was agony in his voice. “I swear I do&mdash;only for
you and Uncle. Well, Eva, you must go home and
try to make the best of things.”</p>

<p>“What! and leave you out here?” I cried.
“No, indeed, I shall live at Bangalore until your
time is up.”</p>

<p>“Now that is the very craziest nonsense; you
must return to Torrington and marry Falkland.”</p>

<p>For the moment I failed to think of an appropriate
answer. Why remind poor Ronnie that as the sister
of a convict I could never be Brian’s wife, or
presume to enter his proud and exclusive family?</p>

<p>“I do not wish to marry,” I muttered at last,
and then hastily turned the subject by asking him
if he wanted money.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he replied, “a paternal government
provides everything, kit and all, and I start to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>-morrow
under escort. It was decent of them to
let you see me, and in my own clothes. Good-bye,
dear old girl; you’ve been a real brick to me. Now
I implore you to take your own line and not bother
any more about your scamp of a brother. Do you
remember when we sat on the bridge at Beke and
had presentiments, and I swore that I was going
to make the name of Lingard famous? I’ve jolly
well done <i>that</i>!”</p>

<p>“Don’t say such things,” I burst out hysterically.</p>

<p>“I’ll behave like a lamb,” he continued, “and
possibly receive some indulgence, but I’m bound to
be the only officer and gentleman among a very
queer crowd, and I hope the prison diet will put an
end to me long before my term is out.”</p>

<p>At this moment a man whom I had never seen
before entered and signalled that the time was up, and
we embraced in silence. The next morning I was
informed that my brother had been taken away by
night, the authorities sparing him as much publicity
as possible. Having ascertained that Ronnie had
really departed, I proceeded to lay my own plans
before Mrs. Lakin, who protested in long and eloquent
speeches packed with objections; but my mind was
made up, my decision immovable.</p>

<p>“Dearest, kindest Mrs. Lakin,” I said, “Ronnie
and I are all in all to one another; where he goes
<i>I</i> go.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;to jail?”</p>

<p>“No; but perhaps I can find some quiet family
in Bangalore who will be absolute strangers to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
and my affairs. I can see Ronnie from time to
time, and send him books and papers&mdash;he will like
to feel that I am near him.”</p>

<p>“But this is sheer madness, my dear child!
You don’t know a soul in Bangalore.”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” I replied with significant
emphasis.</p>

<p>“If even one of my girls was there&mdash;but Susan
is at Trichinopoly and Alice at Saugor.”</p>

<p>“Do, do help me,” I urged, and slid down from
my chair and laid my hands on her knees. “I would
like to start to-morrow.”</p>

<p>My petition was backed up by Zora, who at this
propitious moment had called to see me, and warmly
approved of my project. That a woman should
make the most absolute sacrifice for a man was
naturally her own (the Mohammedan) point of
view.</p>

<p>“Eva is right,” she declared. “Imagine the
comfort and joy her visits will be to that poor fellow,
cut off from all his friends and associates. I should
think Eva could find a home in some quiet family&mdash;not
perhaps in her own class&mdash;and she can steal away
quietly from here, and no one need know what has
become of her&mdash;only we two. I can take her the
whole way to Wadi in my car; the ayah will go
ahead with luggage and wait there&mdash;and so Miss
Lingard will disappear.”</p>

<p>“Two years in some back-road bungalow in
Bangalore will be a sheer sacrifice of Eva’s youth;
of course she should go home to her people,” pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>tested
Mrs. Lakin, who had sacrificed so much
herself.</p>

<p>“But I have no near relations except Ronnie,”
I announced; “we are orphans. Do you know
Bangalore?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I do, my dear. It was there I was
married&mdash;in Trinity Church.”</p>

<p>“Then probably you can tell me of some people
who would receive me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as for that, I could. I know a nice old
widow, who was my mother’s English maid and
married a half-caste clerk. She is comfortably off,
lives in the infantry lines, and has no family.”</p>

<p>“It seems to be just the place for me!” I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she protested. “I won’t have any
hand in your crazy scheme.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Mrs. Lakin, don’t say that. If you
do, I shall be living in Bangalore, possibly with
people you might not approve of&mdash;unless you or Zora
can suggest something better.”</p>

<p>“I do know people down there,” she admitted,
“but they are in your own class.”</p>

<p>“That would never answer,” I rejoined. “They
would want references and to hear all about me
and my business&mdash;even supposing they’d receive me
as a paying guest.”</p>

<p>I could see that Mrs. Lakin was relenting by
degrees when she said:</p>

<p>“Even if you <i>did</i> go to Mrs. de Castro, it would
take a couple of weeks to make arrangements.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span></p>

<p>“But you can telegraph&mdash;‘reply paid,’” I
suggested.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine why you’re in such a hurry
to get away; I know the rules, and you won’t see
your brother for at least three months.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll see him before that,” I replied with
conviction, “even if I have to go on my knees to
the governor.”</p>

<p>“And, my dear Eva, you have not the faintest idea
of what you are undertaking. Mrs. de Castro will
not charge you more than thirty rupees a month, but
everything will be very coarse and rough. Native
vegetables, bad bazaar bread, second-class fish, and
<i>goat</i>!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind in the least,” I answered recklessly.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose a wilful girl must have her
way,” and after long persistent arguments and an
inexhaustible amount of persuasion I prevailed on my
kind friend to write to her Bangalore acquaintance
on my behalf.</p>

<p>By return of post we received a reply from
Mrs. de Castro, saying that she would “be glad of
the young woman’s company&mdash;and money for her
board.”</p>

<p>When the shock of the verdict had somewhat
abated, I wrote several important letters; it was a
new experience for me to be relying solely on myself.
First I wrote to my bankers, and instructed
them to pay to Colonel Soames the sum of four
hundred pounds, the amount of the missing canteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
money. I felt a great sense of relief as I closed and
addressed this missive; at least the regiment would
not experience any pecuniary loss&mdash;it was their good
name which had suffered. My next letter was to
my uncle. I sent him a long, detailed and truthful
account of the whole tragedy; carefully pointing out
every extenuating circumstance, and endeavouring to
touch his heart. So far he had not answered Ronnie’s
appeal, but I was determined that he should take
notice of mine. Ronnie’s cry was for money&mdash;mine
for sympathy and forgiveness. I also wrote to Mrs.
Paget-Taylor, and implored her to use her influence
to soften my uncle and aunt with respect to my
brother; and last, but not least, I wrote to Brian.
Without any attempt at softening facts, I related the
history of Ronnie’s temptation and disgrace. I said
in the course of the letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ronnie is already a convict in Bangalore jail.
I know that this news will shock you; the whole
affair fell upon me as a thunderbolt. It has all
come from Ronnie’s passion for gambling, which I
honestly believe is his only failing, but has brought
him, as the world can see, to the most frightful
grief. I am sure you will remember how popular he
was with crowds of friends. Well, at the present
moment he has not a single one in the world except
myself, and of course I shall stick to him. He
would to me under similar circumstances. Ronnie
was always the best and kindest of brothers. This
sudden and dreadful trouble will, of course, put an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
end to our engagement. My dearest Brian, how
could you possibly marry the sister of a convict,
who is serving his sentence, and whose case has
rung through every club and every regiment&mdash;not
to speak of the whole Press? I cannot express to
you what this blight on my future costs me. I know
that you will be sorry for me, and perhaps a little
sorry for Ronnie. Please do not write, it would only
make matters worse, for I can never come into your
life, and must do my best to put all thoughts of you
out of my mind. I leave here in a few days to
await in some quiet place, and among total strangers,
the date of Ronnie’s release.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now that my correspondence had been dispatched
by the English mail, I began to make arrangements
for departure, and here I had an active assistant in
Zora. My scheme had her enthusiastic approval.
By her instructions all my pretty, smart dresses,
jewellery and dainty belongings were duly collected,
packed, and sent away to be stored under her
father’s roof till better days dawned. For the next
two years I would have no occasion for smart frocks
or ball gowns, and with only a modest outfit in
two boxes I was ready for my journey. Under my
present circumstances I did not require an ayah, and
old Mary and I separated with mutual regrets. As
for the Lakins, they could not have been kinder or
more sympathetic if I had been their own daughter.
The evening before I departed the colonel beckoned
me mysteriously into his office, and told me in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
low voice that if I wanted money I was to be sure
to apply to him.</p>

<p>“I know,” he added, “that you have a bit the
sale brought you, and I have paid it, as you wished,
into the Bank of Madras; but later on, if you find
yourself getting a little low, you’ve only to drop
me a line, just the same as if you were one of our
girls.”</p>

<p>I endeavoured to thank him, but he would not
listen to me; on the contrary, he insisted on my
listening to <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>“I must tell you that I do not approve of this
step you are taking&mdash;no more does Lucy. Of course
old Jane de Castro will look after you, but you will
find her a dull companion, and I do not see how you
can possibly hold on with her for more than a few
months. I can enter into your feelings in wishing
to be near your brother, but I am sure you ought
to think a little of yourself, and after you have seen
him and cheered him up a bit, you really should
go home.”</p>

<p>I listened to his advice with profound respect,
but I was sensible that nothing would induce me to
accept it. Mrs. Lakin, too, had provided me with
a generous supply of admonition and warnings; and
also endowed me with a basket of provisions that
would have kept a hungry family for a week. She
exhorted me to write to her continually, and actually
threatened to come down to Bangalore in order to
see with her own eyes how I was getting on.</p>

<p>In the midst of our leave-taking talk and Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
Lakin’s last instructions, Zora’s big motor glided into
the compound. My boxes were placed upon the
roof&mdash;a tiffin basket also&mdash;and Zora herself accompanied
me down to Wadi, closely veiled. She gave me
much sweet sympathy and many wise injunctions,
saw me into a comfortable carriage in the Madras
mail, and behold me launched into a new world!</p>

<p>Before my departure I had written to Mrs.
Soames, Mrs. Mills, and other friends, bidding them
farewell, thanking them for all their kindness. To
poor Mrs. Lakin I deputed the heavy and thankless
task of explaining my flight. In answer to
numerous inquiries she assured her questioners that
I had insisted on leaving, in spite of all that she
could urge or do, but the truth was, I could not endure
to remain in Secunderabad. I had been very
mysterious about my destination and address; my
desire was, if possible, to be absolutely forgotten.
For all these stories may my good kind friend be
absolved.</p>

<p>It was naturally assumed that I had taken flight
to England, until Mrs. Potter announced in the
<i>morghi khana</i> that I had been seen on the road to
Wadi in Balthasar’s great grey motor with luggage
on the top, <i>and not alone</i>. Moreover, it was an
incriminating coincidence that Balthasar himself had
disappeared from Chudderghat on the very same

<span>AT BANGALORE</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">After</span> changing at two junctions, and a tedious but
eventless journey, Kipper and I arrived in Bangalore,
and drove off in a dusty, shuttered gharry to 202
Infantry Lines, the abode of Mrs. de Castro.</p>

<p>Bangalore itself lies chiefly around a maidan
or parade ground about a mile long, bordered with
a ride and trees, and encircled and traversed by
the principal roads in the station. Parallel to the
maidan are the infantry lines; they lie behind what
once were infantry barracks, and are now commissariat
stores. Formerly the bungalows were occupied
by officers, but these quarters&mdash;like the barracks&mdash;have
passed into a different use, and are rented
by clerks, shopkeepers and railway subordinates.
Number 202 was large and old and gloomy,
situated in a small compound with two entrances,
flanked by imposing gate piers, but there were no
gates. The front of the bungalow was completely
veiled by an enormous lattice-work porch, covered
with flowering creepers&mdash;wine-coloured bougainvillea
and blue masses of “morning glory.” The little
drive was full of ruts, the steps up to the veranda
were lined with many pots of caladiums and maidenhair;
evidently these had been recently watered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
for the first sensation I received, with respect to
my new residence, was an all-pervading smell of
wet earth.</p>

<p>As we rumbled up and came to a noisy halt a
little old woman shuffled out of the doorway directly
facing the steps; and as I descended from the gharry
she exclaimed in a shrill, querulous voice:</p>

<p>“So you have brought a <i>dog</i>!”</p>

<p>I hastened to assure her that I could vouch for
Kip’s good conduct, and that he would be no
trouble whatever to her.</p>

<p>“But what about my cats?” she snapped.
“By the look of him I should say he would trouble
<i>them</i>.”</p>

<p>Again I declared that I would be guarantee for
his behaviour.</p>

<p>“And you’re a lady!” she continued in the
same complaining key. “Miss Lucy never told me
that.”</p>

<p>“I hope it is no drawback?”</p>

<p>“Well, it is in a way,” was her unexpected reply.
“I’m not a lady myself. I was a lady’s maid, and
I’ve been looking for a nice homely girl who would
read to me, and run to the bazaar, and be a sort of
companion.”</p>

<p>“I think I can manage all that,” I replied, and
turned to pay off the <i>gharriwan</i>.</p>

<p>The small amount of my luggage undoubtedly
mollified my landlady, and having assured me that I
had given the <i>gharriwan</i> double his fare, with considerable
pomp and circumstance she preceded me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
into the drawing-room, which, as in most old bungalows,
opened directly upon the veranda. Her air
implied that she was now about to exhibit something
superior and out of the common. What a room!
The middle of it was occupied by a vast round ottoman,
hard&mdash;I subsequently learned&mdash;as stone, covered
with the most hideous black and green cretonne I
had ever beheld. The floor had recently been matted
with cheap and odoriferous matting. The walls were
coloured a blinding blue and hung with fearful
chromos. Between the walls, the matting, and the
new cretonne, I gathered that this terrible apartment
had been recently, as it is called, “done up.” There
were a few cane chairs, a blackwood table, and an old
cottage piano with a faded red silk front.</p>

<p>In order to reach my quarters we passed through
a network of small empty chambers to a room which
was large and very bare. A little bed was as an
island in space, the dressing-table was also small,
a camp chest of drawers the sole accommodation
for my wardrobe. As I glanced around this
desert of an apartment, I resolved to supply
myself immediately with a writing-table and an
arm-chair.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that Mrs. de Castro kept but few
servants. The so-called “boy,” a man of forty,
combined the offices of cook and waiter. To me
the food was unfamiliar, and consisted of peculiar
pillau, tank fish, and curries of the most startling
varieties; our fruit was pomegranates and custard-apples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span></p>

<p>Everything, however, was beautifully neat and
clean, and as soon as Mrs. de Castro had resigned
herself to her disappointment in finding me a <i>lady</i>
we settled down together on the most amicable
terms.</p>

<p>My hostess must have been about seventy. Her
sight was rather bad, but otherwise she was by no
means decrepit&mdash;in fact, was surprisingly active for
her age. I let her see at once that I was resolved
to be independent&mdash;to go out and come in precisely
as I pleased; at the same time, I was willing to read
aloud the <i>Bangalore Herald</i>, to write a chit, or even
to carry a message into the bazaar&mdash;which lay at the
end of our road. She quite took to Kip, who soon
established himself in a very secure position in the
house, and we three got on together so well that at
the end of a week I do not think a casual visitor
would have discovered that I had not been living
in Infantry Lines for years. My landlady seldom
went out, save on Sunday across the maidan to
St. Mark’s Church, but she gave me ample directions,
and I soon found my way about our immediate
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>My first distant expedition was to see at least
the exterior of the jail. I think Mrs. de Castro was
not a little astonished at my anxiety to know its
whereabouts.</p>

<p>“The jail is nothing to look at,” she said. “You
go into the Cubbon Park&mdash;there’s a sight for you!
Some day I’ll hire a gharry and take you down to
the Lal Bagh gardens.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span></p>

<p>I had been debating in my own mind whether
I would tell this good woman the whole truth and
nothing but the truth. As a friend of “Miss Lucy’s,”
in other words Mrs. Lakin (to whose mother she had
been maid), I had some claim upon her interest and
loyalty. She entertained a number of visitors,
chiefly women, the wives of shopkeepers, clerks, railway
guards and sergeants&mdash;a particular set of her own.
These swarmed in of an afternoon to have a cup
of coffee in the veranda and enjoy a bit of a talk,
importing all the latest and raciest bazaar gossip, in
which Mrs. de Castro took the most eager interest.
Naturally to such people I was an object of the liveliest
curiosity; with respect to me, I believe these poor
puzzled women floundered about in a very quagmire
of conjecture. I avoided them as far as possible, but
nevertheless I could not wholly evade them, and
their questions and hints were exceedingly sharp.
With Mrs. de Castro sharing my secret I was convinced
that I could hold them at bay, and
accordingly made up my mind to speak. One morning as we
sat at breakfast, I began abruptly:</p>

<p>“Mrs. de Castro, I am sure you wonder what I
am doing here, a stranger to the place. There is not
a soul that I know in the whole of Mysore, save one.
You will also be wondering why I am often asking
questions about the jail? Now I will tell you the
reason&mdash;my brother is there.”</p>

<p>“What!” she cried, “the new superintendent?”</p>

<p>“No, I am sorry to say he is undergoing a two
years’ sentence&mdash;his name is Captain Lingard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span></p>

<p>“Oh lor!” she cried, lifting up her withered
hands, “do you tell me so? I heard about the
officer from my husband’s nephew, who is head
warder. And so that’s what’s brought you to
the station. Dear, dear, dear! What’s he been
a-doin’ of?”</p>

<p>“It was about money,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Ay,” she answered sagely, “it is always money
or women.”</p>

<p>“My brother took funds belonging to the regiment,
intending to repay them, but before he could
do so they were missed.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” she exclaimed, “and then the fat was in
the fire! Jail,” she continued, “is a terrible place
for a young gentleman&mdash;indeed, it’s not very what
you may call homey for anyone.”</p>

<p>“I believe it will break my brother’s heart,” I
said. “I have told you this, Mrs. de Castro, because
I think you feel kindly towards me.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, to be sure,” she mumbled.</p>

<p>“And I want you to keep this dreadful thing a
dead secret?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, and I’ll do anything for Miss
Lucy’s friend; but the women who come here are
just chock full of curiosity. They can see what you
are, and they think it mighty queer your living in this
small humble way. Well, I must compose some sort
of a fairy tale to tell them.”</p>

<p>“Tell them that I’m eccentric,” I suggested;
“that I come to you to be very, very quiet&mdash;tell
them that I’m writing a book.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that’ll do splendidly, and you can
have your writing-table put in one of the little rooms,
and keep yourself as much to yourself as you please,
whilst I throw dust in their eyes.”</p>

<p>“I think I shall go up to the jail this evening,”
I said. “I’ve been here a fortnight, and have never
made it out yet.”</p>

<p>“No, no, early to-morrow would be your best
time. Not that you would <i>see</i> him&mdash;don’t you run
away with that notion; but you might chance on
Mr. Hodson, the superintendent, about nine o’clock,
and get a few words with him, and as you’re so
nice spoken&mdash;and so nice looking&mdash;perhaps he might
make things a bit easy.”</p>

<p>The next morning after I had had my early tea&mdash;at
Mrs. de Castro’s it was not tea but excellent
Mysore coffee&mdash;I tied up the reproachful Kipper
in the veranda, and received instructions as to
the route from my hostess, who escorted me to
the entrance, still wearing a bed jacket and red
felt slippers.</p>

<p>“You’ll just go round this corner”&mdash;(ours was
a corner house)&mdash;“up on to the Cubbon Road, past
the magazine, and then turn into the Petta Road;
walk along that till you come to Government Offices,
the D.P.W.&mdash;my husband was a clerk in them&mdash;go
round that corner, and you’ll find yourself on
the way that leads to the racecourse&mdash;the jail is
on your left. The whole distance isn’t more than
a mile and a quarter. I expect people will think
it strange to see a nice-looking young lady like you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
tramping about in the dust all by herself; they’ll
be wondering who you are, and what’s your business.
I’m sure Mrs. Cotton and Mrs. Dicks, my
neighbours, will do their dead best to dig it out of
me, but I can be as close as a snail. Well, well,”
she concluded, “mind you don’t stay out too long in
the sun.” And with this adjuration she left me.</p>

<span>WITHIN THE PRECINCTS</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> resolved on, yet dreaded, this expedition, knowing
that to see even the outside of the place where
Ronnie was imprisoned would fill me with sickening
horror; but the longer I deferred the excursion the
more reluctant I should be to face it. I reasoned
down my antipathy and shrinking, and urged myself
not to be a fool. Was I not living in Bangalore solely
to be near Ronnie? And I wished him to know what
would surely comfort him: that I was within reach.</p>

<p>It was a delightfully fresh morning as I started
forth and took a short cut over the maidan. In the
distance I noticed a regiment on parade and a number
of people riding. As I made my way across the track
a girl passed me, galloping along with a radiant face.
How she was enjoying herself! Six weeks ago and
I had been as she! but now, I seemed to have lost
my identity.</p>

<p>Leaving the maidan behind me, I turned into
the Petta Road and, at the end of a short walk,
found myself outside the precincts of the jail. After
considerable delay I was admitted by a warder,
ushered into a large, bare, whitewashed room, and
invited to state my business.</p>

<p>“I wish to see the superintendent,” I murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span></p>

<p>“The superintendent is engaged, but perhaps
the deputy will give you an interview.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I assented, “but if it were possible
I should feel obliged if the superintendent could see
me even for a moment.”</p>

<p>After waiting for about half an hour I was escorted
to an office, in the middle of which was a large table,
and sitting at it a stout, elderly, dark man in a
sort of blue serge undress, with letters on his collar.
He looked up interrogatively as I entered, and said:</p>

<p>“About the vegetables, I presume, madam?”
(All Indian jails supply these.)</p>

<p>“No,” I replied in a faint and tremulous key.
“I have called to inquire about my brother, Captain
Lingard?”</p>

<p>The superintendent hastily pushed back his chair
and rose; he appeared too astonished to articulate,
and gazed at me in a sort of dull amazement.</p>

<p>“I am staying in Bangalore in order to be near
him,” I continued.</p>

<p>“With friends?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>“Oh no, just lodging with a woman in the Infantry
Lines, Mrs. de Castro.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, her nephew has a post here. You
are not staying for any time, I presume?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>“But what about your relatives in England&mdash;will
they think it suitable?”</p>

<p>I made no reply. I had come to ask questions, not
to supply information.</p>

<p>“About my brother&mdash;how is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, it’s a sad business&mdash;such a nice young
fellow!”</p>

<p>“Is he at all&mdash;at all&mdash;reconciled?” I faltered.</p>

<p>“No, he is taking it terribly hard&mdash;does not eat,
does not speak, and they say he does not sleep. He
has lost seven pounds in weight; if he goes on like
this we must put him in hospital.”</p>

<p>“What does he have to eat?” I inquired.</p>

<p>The official turned about, took down a card from
the wall and, without a word, handed it to me for
reference. Glancing over it I read: “Every European
prisoner is provided with a tin plate, mug and
spoon. The following is the daily dietary, prescribed
for a European prisoner on hard labour.”</p>

<p>“<i>Hard labour!</i>” I read aloud, and looked at the
official interrogatively, who nodded in reply.</p>

<p>The list further continued: “Bread 24 oz., rice
8 oz., beef or fish 10 oz., vegetables 8 oz., tea 1/4 oz.,
sugar 1/2 oz., salt 3/4 oz., condiments ditto, milk 4 oz.”</p>

<p>“Quite a liberal diet,” remarked the superintendent,
as I returned the card.</p>

<p>“And is my brother really doing hard labour?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; he is a fine muscular young fellow, the
exercise will be good for him. Just at the moment
he is pounding coco-nuts with a wooden mallet.
After a time, if he conducts himself well, he will be
made a convict warder.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“He is given authority over the other prisoners,
and does no work himself. He preserves discipline,
is among the convicts day and night, and has charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
of his own ward. Of course he receives no pay and
wears the prison dress; eats the same food, and is
subject to discipline himself. Being an educated
man, your brother, if he behaves well, is bound to
get a billet either as warder, or to keep the jail
books, or superintend the carpenters’ shops.”</p>

<p>“How soon will he get one of these posts?”
I inquired.</p>

<p>“Not for some time, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“When may I see him?”</p>

<p>“In about ten weeks. Every three months
prisoners are allowed to receive visitors.”</p>

<p>“Ten weeks!” I repeated. “Oh, do let me have
one word with him <i>now</i>; do, I implore you.”</p>

<p>“My dear young lady, I dare not break the rules,”
he protested, “though I pity you from the bottom
of my heart.”</p>

<p>“But think of him, cut off from everything&mdash;everything
he has been used to, absolutely friendless,
and cast among natives and criminals. He has no
idea that I am in Bangalore. Surely I may send
him one line to comfort him?”</p>

<p>“No, no, no, that would be against all rules.”</p>

<p>“It’s like beating with bare hands on a stone
wall,” I cried in despair. “It makes me frantic to
realise that I am within a few yards of my brother,
and may not see him!”</p>

<p>“Well, if it comes to that, I might stretch a
point,” said the superintendent. “He may not see
you, but if you think you can bear it, I might let
you have a peep at <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you a thousand times.”</p>

<p>“All right then, if you will not be upset, I’ll
take you up to a place where you can get a glimpse
of the yard.”</p>

<p>As he concluded, the kindly superintendent rose,
opened a door, and ushered me along some bare stone
passages. Then we passed through a large room,
where convicts were working at hand looms, weaving
various beautiful Indian carpets. They seemed to
be really interested and engrossed in their work,
which looked exceedingly intricate and tedious. My
escort halted before one loom where two men were
working, and pointed out a lovely blue and cream
carpet, about half completed.</p>

<p>“This has been commissioned by an English
countess,” he explained. “It has taken six months’
work, so far; most of the carpets on the looms are
already sold; this is a particularly fine specimen,
and we are very proud of it.”</p>

<p>He said something to the workers in their own
language, and they received his comments with wide
and appreciative grins.</p>

<p>But I had come to see Ronnie&mdash;not carpets&mdash;and
I think my companion instinctively felt that I had
no wish to linger; so he soon escorted me out of
the department into another section. As we proceeded,
he informed me that at the moment they
had five hundred inmates in the prison, mostly men,
who did all the domestic and garden work, besides
weaving carpets and making tents and gunny bags.</p>

<p>“This is the central jail,” he added, “the only one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
in the province; the rest are merely district jails and
lock-ups. You would be surprised at the number
of old people that are confined in India. They are
sworn in by their families, in place of younger men,
who are the real criminals, and they are fairly well
provided for for the rest of their lives.”</p>

<p>To which statement&mdash;mentioned in the most
casual manner&mdash;I listened with indignant horror.</p>

<p>I was also not a little moved by the number of
convicts we encountered as we went along the stone
passages. Every one of them wore irons on his
legs, which clanked as he walked. Both prisoners
and warders glanced at me furtively as I passed.
Lady customers were no doubt occasionally to be
seen in the carpet department, but <i>I</i> was in the
division reserved for hard labour criminals and the
most desperate characters. At last we reached a flight
of steep steps, and climbed into a little room overlooking
a yard, which was enclosed with high spiked
walls. Here a number of prisoners were thumping
coco-nuts with wooden mallets, “to make coir,” as
my companion explained to me. They wore cotton
coats, drawers, and caps stamped with that significant
mark the broad arrow, and every man was fettered
from ankle to knee. As my eyes roved anxiously
among the crowd I realised that they were all natives
of the country except one&mdash;one with a rigid white
face, who was pounding away with a sort of mechanical
ferocity.</p>

<p>At first I did not recognise him, and thought with
a little dart of relief, “Here at least is a companion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
for Ronnie;” and then I realised that it was Ronnie
himself! Changed, oh, incredibly changed, in two
short weeks! I was so horrified and so suddenly
unstrung that, almost in spite of myself, I screamed
out “Ronnie!” I saw him look up, but I think the
steady thumping of the wooden mallets had deadened
my cry. My companion, who was extremely angry,
seized me by the arm and drew me forcibly out of
the room.</p>

<p>“There you see, that is what I get for my kindness!”
he said indignantly. “It will be a lesson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, forgive me, <i>do</i> forgive me,” I sobbed. “I
couldn’t help it.” And then I leant against the wall and
wept. I think this was almost the bitterest moment
of my whole life. There was my brother, the image of
despair, working out his sentence within those tall
ugly walls, out off from everything he had ever cared
for. I believe my tears somewhat appeased the
superintendent.</p>

<p>“Don’t take on, don’t take on. Come away
down to my room,” he said, “and pull yourself
together a bit.”</p>

<p>As soon as we had reached this haven, he offered
me a chair and sent for a glass of water, and when
I was more composed he said:</p>

<p>“I was afraid you might be upset.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am, my brother looks as if he were
dying.”</p>

<p>“He looks badly, I grant you&mdash;they all do at
first&mdash;I mean the Europeans. It isn’t often we
have them&mdash;not for years. A private was hanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
ages ago, for shooting his comrade in the barrack
room. I remember as if it was yesterday, the escort
marching him up from cells just after daybreak one
December morning, and the band playing the Dead
March in ‘Saul.’”</p>

<p>I shuddered involuntarily.</p>

<p>“This is only a second class jail,” he resumed.
“Serious cases are sent elsewhere. Your brother
was moved down here for two reasons; the authorities
did not wish to have him so near the regimental
lines as Secunderabad jail. Every time a Tommy
went by ‘Windsor Castle’ he would think ‘One of
our captains is lying in there.’ Another thing, the
Bangalore climate is less trying; we have no real
hot weather, and of course there are no punkahs
in jails. It’s just a year ago since I saw Captain
Lingard playing here in the polo tournament. There
wasn’t one to touch him! He seemed to have complete
command of his ponies, and his strokes were a
wonder. I little thought that his next visit to the
station would be to <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“No; who could have dreamt of such a thing?
It all seems like a hideous nightmare.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Miss Lingard, as far as I can I will
help your brother, but to show partiality to one
man because he is of my own race would upset all
discipline, and lose me influence and authority. As
it is, I have an unruly crowd to deal with; we’ve had
more than one unpleasant outbreak. I believe there
is one thing I can do for you&mdash;I will overstep my
rules for once, and will give your brother a message.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span></p>

<p>“Will you? That really <i>is</i> kind.”</p>

<p>“Well, what shall I say?”</p>

<p>“Give him my love, and tell him that I am in
Bangalore, and hope to see him on the first visiting
day. Tell him that I am living with a respectable
old widow, and that he is never, never out of my
thoughts. Ask him to try and look at the bright side
of things and to think of the future, when we shall
be together, and all this trouble will have passed over
like a thunderstorm. May I send him books?”</p>

<p>“No, but he can have the use of the prison library,
such as it is.”</p>

<p>“Should I be allowed to present books to the prison
library? As you so seldom have a European here,
your stock must be rather low.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” he admitted. “I don’t do much
reading myself, but I think the books there are nearly
all missionary stuff, sent in from somebody’s sale.
You might be allowed to present a few, and you
could forward them through me. You must cheer
up a bit,” he added; “after all, the two years will
soon run round.”</p>

<p>“Two years of a living death,” I protested;
“what an awful punishment for a momentary madness!
My brother was dreadfully in debt, the money
tempted him; he meant of course to replace it, but
there was no time. It has been paid back now.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I understand that it was gambling brought
Captain Lingard to this. It has landed a good
many natives here&mdash;chiefly Burmese and Malays.
The Burman is an inveterate gambler, so are China<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>men.
Most of our local cases are village brawls, theft
and murder. Well now,” he said, rising, “I must
ask you to excuse me; this is my very busy time.
Would you like me to send for a gharry?”</p>

<p>I had intended to walk back, but I now felt so
utterly shattered that this feat would be impossible,
so I thankfully accepted the superintendent’s offer,
and was presently being bowled away to Infantry
Lines.</p>

<p>All that day I lay on my bed prostrate, for I
now acutely realised the weight of Ronnie’s sentence.
Would he ever survive to complete it? Could
that convict with the fixed white face and the
sunken staring eyes be my handsome, cheery
brother?</p>

<p>I think Mrs. de Castro understood that I had recently
received a terrible shock. She brought me her
recipe for all trouble&mdash;a cup of the most excellent
coffee&mdash;as well as a bottle of eau-de-Cologne with
which to bathe my throbbing head. Kip also was
tenderly attentive. He knew that I was in some
sore grief; his eloquent eyes spoke volumes, and he
licked my hand from time to time, doing all in his
power to offer me his dumb sympathy.</p>

<p>No doubt it was the reaction from all I had
gone through, culminating in my visit to the jail
and sight of Ronnie as a convict, but after this
expedition I broke down. I did not actually become
a bedridden invalid, but I seemed to have lost all
energy. I could not eat, I slept badly, and I was
subject to exhaustive fits of crying. Mrs. de Castro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
was seriously concerned, and endeavoured to feed
me, dose me, and scold me into a more cheerful frame
of mind. She explained, with much wisdom, that I
could do no good to my brother by starving and
fretting and ruining my health.</p>

<p>One morning she threw two letters on my writing-table
and said:</p>

<p>“These have just come by the dâk, and I expect
<i>they’ll</i> cheer you a bit!”</p>

<p>I glanced at them, and saw they had been readdressed
by Mrs. Lakin. The first I seized upon
and opened was from Brian, which said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My darling Eva</span>,&mdash;By bad luck I missed writing
to you last week, but it happened to be the day
of my father’s operation; my mother was dreadfully
anxious and upset, and I forgot the Indian mail. My
poor little girl, all this trouble about your brother
has been a terrible affair for you, but I do not see
why it should be the means of breaking off our
engagement, nor will <i>I</i> ever consent to it. As Mrs.
Falkland you will have done with the name and association
of Lingard, and even if people remembered
that your brother had been tried and convicted, instead
of being censorious they would be sincerely
sorry for you. I am, as you expected, also sorry
for your brother. When I was out at Secunderabad
I could not help seeing the way things were going,
and once or twice I tried to give him a hint, but it
was no use. I also had an idea of talking to you on
the subject, but on second thoughts I decided it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
better not to disturb you, and I did not expect matters
would have come to a crisis so soon. I also consoled
myself with the saying that ‘half the troubles in this
world are those that never happen.’ This trouble
unfortunately <i>has</i> come off! I think you are foolish
in remaining out in India&mdash;whereabouts you do not
say. Just at first I know that your brother will not
be allowed to see a visitor, so your presence in the
country won’t be much good to him. No doubt he
will be promoted into a post where he need not
mix with the worst class of criminals. I wish it
were in my power to do something to alleviate his
horrible condition, or to reduce the term, but no
doubt his own conduct and character will effect that.
My poor little girl, I cannot tell you how acutely
I feel for you; I know that this trouble is heart-breaking.
I will write next mail, and I implore you
when you receive this to cable your address, and
send me a letter to say that second thoughts are
best, and you are returning home to</p>

<p>
“Your always devoted,<br />
“<span class="smcap">Brian</span>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This letter I read over three times before I opened
the next. It gave me courage and a momentary gleam
of happiness; nevertheless, I was determined to remain
in Bangalore and stick to Ronnie. Supposing
I were to go home as Brian suggested, and abandon
Ronnie to his fate; in spite of my fiancé’s comforting
words I believed that all my acquaintances would
look upon me coldly and obviously strive to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
the subjects of brothers, convicts and jail out of their
conversation.</p>

<p>My next letter was from Aunt Mina:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Eva</span>,&mdash;Your uncle has deputed me to
answer your letter, and I commence it by saying
that although we have a knave in the family, we see
no reason to tolerate a <i>fool</i>. Your brother, who
has blackened the Lingard name, disgraced us and
you, is the knave, but you, who have rushed after
him, leaving the shelter of your friends at Secunderabad,
are acting like a fool. You must return home
<i>at once</i>. Your uncle, who stands in the place of a
parent to you, desires me to say that there is to be
no question of this. We expect you to start within
a week from the date on which you receive this letter.
You will, of course, come to Torrington and make
your home here. We understand that you have paid
up the money of the canteen fund. Your uncle had
intended to do this. He desires me to say that
a cheque for your passage home will be lodged;
you are to return by the P. &amp; O., and will be met
at Southampton. Should you refuse to obey, and
set your face against our plans, the hundred a
year allowance will cease; not only this, but your
future proceedings will be of no further interest to
this family and we shall look upon you as much
dead to us as is your brother. I know you are
always inclined to be headstrong, and to wild and
impulsive actions, but on this occasion I sincerely
hope your recent experience will have taught you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
<i>humility</i> and common sense. We are inclined to fear
that <i>you</i> may have contributed to Ronnie’s disaster.
A girl of your age, with no experience of India,
possibly spent extravagantly and incurred large bills.
Apparently it is only since <i>you</i> have lived with Ronnie
that he has come to grief. Of course our conjectures
may be mistaken&mdash;I am sure I hope so. This terrible
family scandal has tried us greatly. The case was
in every newspaper, with a <i>portrait</i>; and at present&mdash;speaking
for myself&mdash;I do not care to go about
and meet my neighbours. However, dear Mrs. Paget-Taylor
is, as usual, a wonderful consoler and a tower
of strength. By this day month, at the latest, we
shall look for your arrival. I see that the <i>Malwa</i>
sails on the 27th.</p>

<p>
“Your affectionate aunt,<br />
“<span class="smcap">Wilhelmina Lingard</span>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>I did not read <i>this</i> letter over three times, but giving
way to one of my childish passions I tore it into little
bits, and then, while the fit was still upon me, sat down
and dashed off what I have no doubt was considered
a most intemperate reply. I refused absolutely to
return to England, and said that I was satisfied
to take my place beside Ronnie and be repudiated
by the family; their money I did not want&mdash;and I
remained faithfully, Eva Lingard.</p>

<p>Thus I was now cut off from my few relations,
and had, with my own hands, barred the doors of
Torrington.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_27">CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span>DARK DAYS</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Without</span> a day’s delay I sent down to Higginbotham’s
in Madras and ordered a large supply of
books. When these arrived I scribbled in some of
them in French, hoping that Ronnie might discover
my messages. I implored him to make the best
of everything (as I was doing), not to lose heart,
but to look forward to better days when we would
be always together. I assured him that as soon
as permitted I would go to see him, and that I was
“keeping up,” and he must do the same. Then I
packed up the parcel and dispatched it to the jail by
a coolie, with a note to the superintendent reminding
him of his promise to allow me to add to the library.
I had written as cheerfully as I could, but though I
assured Ronnie that I was “keeping up,” I regret
to say this was not the truth. In spite of the consolations
offered by Kip and Mrs. de Castro, I was
abjectly miserable, a wraith of my former self. My
face looked small and pinched and my eyes were
sore from secret weeping, for always in my mind I
saw Ronnie’s expression of absolute despair, and
ever in my ears sounded the “chink, chink, chink”
of the convicts’ irons.</p>

<p>Such was my depression that Mrs. de Castro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
was roused to what were, for her, desperate and
expensive remedies. Almost every afternoon she
hired a second-class gharry from the bazaar, and
carried me out to “eat the air.” Once we drove
down to the celebrated Lal Bagh, those beautiful
gardens, said to have been laid out by Hyder Ali. I
confess that I enjoyed this excursion, although I
skulked in out-of-the-way paths, for fear of meeting
some of the fashionable European community. Mrs.
de Castro understood this attitude; her sympathy
was full of insight, and our future drives were in
directions where one was not likely to come across
any of the gay world from the cantonments. We
went expeditions to Cleveland Town and round the
Ulsoor Tank, but the cantonment bazaar and shops
were a magnet that proved irresistible to my companion.
Many a half-hour I would sit in the gharry,
whilst she bargained over a couple of yards of calico,
a bar of soap, or a tin of biscuits&mdash;speaking Tamil as
her native tongue.</p>

<p>If she came off best these proceedings afforded her
as much pleasure as if she had been to a play or a
concert, possibly more. Her haunts were not the
modern European emporium, but out-of-the-way
streets and alleys near the grain market, and the
Arale-Petta&mdash;both busy scenes of bartering and
traffic.</p>

<p>Occasionally I accompanied her into these places,
and whilst she chaffered, what strange discoveries I
made, as I poked round in the dim interiors! Sometimes
it was piles of ancient “tinned” soups and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
vegetables, that may have been on the premises for
half a century; sometimes it was dusty piles of old
books, broken furniture, spotted prints, chairs with
the stuffing coming out, the remains of chandeliers
(so dear to the Oriental heart), and now and then a
really good piece of furniture, such as a Chippendale
seat, or a French mirror, covered with dust and
cobwebs&mdash;possibly wondering what <i>they</i> were doing in
<i>cette galère</i>.</p>

<p>These expeditions were no doubt undertaken
for my health and with a view to raising my spirits,
but I cannot say that they accomplished their object.
Now and then we walked in the Cubbon Park, and
every Sunday I accompanied my landlady to church.
In the mornings, as I exercised Kipper along the
least frequented roads, although I was plainly and
even shabbily dressed, I noticed that people stared
hard at me. In India, stray and solitary females
are exceptional. There one belongs to a family and
household, and is bound to have some <i>raison d’être</i> for
residing in the country. To meet a strange English
girl, whose appearance was unfamiliar, at bandstand
or social gatherings, and who had apparently no other
companion than a fox-terrier, gave those who encountered
me legitimate reason to stare and to wonder.</p>

<p>Many inquiries were made by Mrs. de Castro’s
circle. It was evident from her disclosures that
they were not entirely satisfied with her tales of my
eccentricity and book writing. I promptly realised
that the less mystery about me in our household the
better. I had no objection to associating with Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
de Castro’s neighbours and set, and made it my
business of an afternoon to come into the veranda
and help to make coffee and conversation, and to
hand about “hoppers” and rock cakes. After all,
it was the least I could do in acknowledgment of my
hostess’s well-meant kindnesses, such as the drives to
the bazaar, and the packets of peppermint, the little
bunches of monthly roses and oleanders with which
she endowed me. I could not take an active part in
discussing bazaar prices, nor enjoy succulent particulars
of the whims and shortcomings of other ladies and
their families in Infantry Lines and St. John’s Hill.
It was a matter of indifference to me, nor was I in
the least excited to learn that “Mrs. Captain Watson
had had five ayahs in a fortnight,” but on the subject
of dress my foot was more or less upon my native
heath, and I was in a position to offer Mrs. Sergeant
Mullins and Mrs. Conductor Cooper some really
useful information; I was also prepared to lend
them a pattern blouse and “the new skirt.” By
this generosity I captured their hearts!</p>

<p>“You’re not very dressy, and you don’t go out
much yourself,” remarked Mrs. Batt, the wife of a
retired sapper&mdash;a nice-looking elderly woman, with
sharp grey eyes and an assertive manner&mdash;to me,
one of the most formidable of the company.</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, returning her challenge, and
looking her straight in the face; “Mrs. de Castro
may possibly have told you that I have come to
Bangalore for complete quiet and retirement. I
know no one here, which under the circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
is the greatest advantage. I have lately experienced
an overwhelming sorrow.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Batt coolly inspected me up and down; no,
I was not wearing mourning.</p>

<p>“And,” I continued, “I am not disposed to
return to England&mdash;at present.”</p>

<p>I believe this statement satisfied the company.
With one consent they very naturally attributed my
melancholy and reserve to a love affair that had
gone wrong, which idea after all had a substantial
basis&mdash;my love affair <i>had</i> gone wrong&mdash;but, unfortunately,
that was only a part of my trouble.
It is an undeniable fact that all womenkind are
interested in affairs of the heart, and my new acquaintances
accorded me their unspoken sympathy.
For this I had no doubt to thank their natural kind-heartedness,
but perhaps my generosity in the matter
of advice and patterns may have had a little weight.
In future, however, Mrs. de Castro was no longer
submitted to the “question torture.” I was received
as an acknowledged member of her set, and she was
left in peace. I made myself as useful to my landlady
as possible; read her the <i>Bangalore Herald</i>
from end to end, wrote her notes, played draughts
and trimmed her Sunday toque. Considering our
respective ages, education and station, we really
got on together amazingly well. She had been most
loyal to me. I can never forget how once, when
Mrs. Cotton touched upon my tragedy, and began:
“They <i>do</i> say there’s an English officer in the jail&mdash;such
a handsome fellow too&mdash;&mdash;” she cleverly turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
the subject with a fresh and startling scandal. I
had impressed upon her that if any of the military
people&mdash;who of course were aware of my brother’s
fate&mdash;came to dream of my presence in Bangalore
I would depart within the hour. I was quite sure,
I added, that if they <i>did</i> know they would be only
too kind to me, but their kindness, however well
meant, I should not yet be able to endure. My
wound was still so raw that I shrank from even a
touch of sympathy.</p>

<p>The <i>dâk-wallah’s</i> arrival with his big brown wallet
invariably excited my interest. From time to time
he brought me letters from Mrs. Lakin. On one
occasion her dispatch was so heavy as to require five
annas postage, as it enclosed others. One was from
Captain Hayes-Billington, to tell me that his wife
had passed away. It was apparently written in great
distress, the thin cheap paper blistered with tears:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She asked me to be sure and let <i>you</i> know;
Dulcie was always fond of you. Ever since she
came down here she has been failing, and by degrees
just faded away out of life. She was glad to go&mdash;but
<i>I</i> am heart-broken.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Lakin, who was my constant correspondent,
announced in her letter that they were leaving
Secunderabad immediately:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My dear, such an uprooting after thirty years
in India! I cannot bear to think of how our poor
household gods will be scattered. Some, such as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
Deschamps furniture, I intend to take home; some
I shall send to the girls. One of them will give the
old chestnut horse a stall and a feed. I have endowed
my ayah and butler with a cow apiece, and distributed
my poultry among the women in the lines&mdash;but what
am I to do about your letters? I enclose two. How
are your correspondents to find you? Here it is
generally believed that you have returned to London;
even Mrs. Soames is off the scent. She intends when
the regiment does go home to look up your relatives
and discover your whereabouts.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. de Castro was always gratified when I had
a letter from “Miss Lucy,” as she still called her. The
letter invariably contained kind messages to “Jane.”</p>

<p>“It seems only the other day since she came out
to India,” she remarked (when I told her the news),
“and now she’s going home for good. I remember
her, such a slim young lady with lovely blue eyes
and curly hair. It was not long before Mr. Lakin
fell in love with her. He was only a lieutenant in a
Madras Native Infantry regiment, but in spite of
all her father and mother could say (and they said
a <i>lot</i>) she would have him; and they took a little
bungalow at thirty rupees a month at St. John’s
Hill. Well, the match didn’t turn out so badly after
all. Colonel Lakin will have a good pension, and
after their long spell out here they’ll enjoy themselves
in England.”</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Lakin returned to “enjoy herself in
England” she enclosed me another letter, which was
from Brian. It said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My darling Eva</span>,&mdash;You are making me miserable.
I cannot understand why you do not write to
me, and I have no idea where you are, so send this to
care of your good friend Mrs. Lakin. Probably you are
hiding in some little hill station, for the hot weather
will by this time be upon you. But why hide from
<i>me</i>? Why not trust me as I trust you? I had an
anonymous epistle from Secunderabad recently, announcing
that you had been seen driving all over
the place in Balthasar’s motor, and that it was well
known that you had actually left the place in his
company. I need not tell you that I didn’t believe
one word of this. I put the poisonous letter in the
fire and would have liked to do the same with the
writer! You will probably have seen the announcement
of my father’s death in the papers; he
passed away a fortnight ago; to the last we had
hopes. My mother is completely broken down, and I
have no end of family matters to get through. Only
for my mother’s health, and most urgent business,
I would go out to India in the place of this letter.
Last week I motored over to Torrington, thinking
that I might glean news of you, but I was astonished
to find that you were as much in their
black books as your brother. I wonder what you
have been doing, Eva? I asked the question
point blank, but as our engagement has never
been given out, they evidently thought me guilty
of unpardonable cheek, and implied that their
family affairs were no business of mine&mdash;they let me
see it too! They are taking the court martial, etc.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
terribly to heart, and are going abroad for six months
with the idea of living the whole thing down. If
they didn’t make so much of it themselves, other
people would soon let it drop. I hear from Secunderabad
from time to time; the general impression there
seems to be that you are in England. I am told that
the Lakins are coming home, so that I can no longer
write to you to their address. Surely you will answer
<i>this</i>!</p>

<p>
“Your, as always, devoted and faithful<br />
“<span class="smcap">Brian</span>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>I was much surprised one afternoon to see a carriage
and pair drive under our porch&mdash;Mrs. de Castro’s
visitors came in gharries or on foot. She rushed to
me with a scared face, waving a visiting card in her
hand.</p>

<p>“It’s Mrs. Hodson, the wife of the superintendent
of the jail; she’s asking to see you!”</p>

<p>All sorts of dreadful visions passed through my
mind. Could Ronnie be dead, and had she come to
break the news?</p>

<p>“Show her into my little room,” I said&mdash;one of
the bare apartments I had fixed up with a writing-table,
a few cheap chairs and a couple of rugs. Here
I sat, read, and worked&mdash;nothing would induce me
to frequent the dismal drawing-room.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Hodson was ushered in; a plain
pale woman, with a long thoughtful face and a
pleasant smile.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t think that I have taken a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
liberty,” she said, “but my husband thought that
perhaps you might like to make my acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“It is most kind of you,” I murmured; “won’t
you sit down?”</p>

<p>“You do not know anyone here, nor wish to
know them, I understand, but still perhaps you
will make an exception of me. You might like to
come up and sit in our lovely garden and feel that
you are near him, and that we are always ready
to befriend you both.”</p>

<p>“You are <i>very</i> kind,” I repeated. “Can you
tell me how he is?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is more resigned. Since he has had
your message and those books you sent to the library
he seems more cheerful, and is no longer losing weight.
As he is steady they have made him a convict warder,
so now the rules are relaxed. You will be able to
see him to-morrow afternoon, and I will send the
carriage for you.”</p>

<p>I was so overpowered by this unexpected news
that for a moment I could not speak.</p>

<p>“There was a fortnight yet,” I stammered at last.</p>

<p>“That is true, but a convict warder has privileges,
and sees his friends oftener than once in three months.
You look so white and sad, I wonder if you would
care to come for a drive with me? Yes, and we will
take your dog, and go up past the racecourse along
the Nundy Droog Road, where you will get plenty
of air, and scarcely meet a soul.”</p>

<p>“I should like it immensely,” I said, springing up,
“and I’ll fetch my hat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span></p>

<p>As I left the room, I nearly collided with Mrs. de
Castro, who was bearing in with her own hands a
tray of cakes and coffee. There was no avoiding
this refreshment, and I could see that she was extremely
proud of entertaining the wife of the jail
superintendent in her own house.</p>

<p>I enjoyed that drive more than anything for
a very long time. The fresh air and the swift motion
revived me. How different from rumbling along in a
gharry with my landlady, who preferred excursions
into the bazaar, or down St. John’s Hill, and had
no taste whatever for the open country! We passed
cheery parties of riders coming from the racecourse;
among them I recognised a man I had seen at Silliram,
and hastily turned away my face. Mrs. Hodson
was not a steady talker like Mrs. Soames, or my
former self, but she opened her mind to me and took
me into her confidence.</p>

<p>“In one way you and I are both in the same
boat,” she said. “You shrink from society because
of your brother’s trouble&mdash;society shrinks from me
because I, an Englishwoman, and well born, have
married a Eurasian or Anglo-Indian, as they are now
called. I have never, never regretted the step, excepting
that it cuts me off from women of my own
class. They will talk to me, and even come to my
house, and admire my garden, but between us all
the time a great gulf is fixed. I was a governess
out here; my health broke down, and I was almost
penniless when Richard Hodson came to my rescue&mdash;or
rather his sister did. Ultimately we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
married, and in my way I am happy. If I had
one or two real women friends I’d have nothing
left to wish for. At first the jail and the convicts
depressed me. The ‘chink, chink, chink’ of the
irons moving to and fro about the garden got on
my nerves, but now I do not seem to hear them!
To-morrow you must come and see my garden. I
wanted so much to have your brother to work in
it; it’s healthier and more interesting than making
gunny bags, but when my husband spoke to him he
said that nothing would induce him to show himself
out of doors.”</p>

<p>The next afternoon Mrs. Hodson’s pretty victoria
arrived to carry me to the jail. My heart was
thumping hard as we drove along, and when I got
out and was received by the superintendent I was
trembling so much that I could scarcely walk. However,
I managed to crawl to the room where
prisoners received their friends and there I found
Ronnie awaiting me.</p>

<p>At first he bore up wonderfully, but for my part
I was so overcome that I could only weep and murmur,
“Ronnie! Ronnie!” At last he too broke
down. The spectacle of a man crying is inexpressibly
tragic. I thrust my own miseries aside and
did my utmost to console him. I felt something
like a nurse comforting a child that has hurt itself.
“What was the use of anything?” he murmured,
why look forward? He was branded for life; wherever
he went the horror would follow; no nice girl
would ever marry <i>him</i>! After a time, when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
were more collected, he said in his old peremptory
style:</p>

<p>“Now you know, Eva, it’s all wrong your being
out here. I won’t allow you to sacrifice yourself for
me. You really must and shall go home.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t go home,” I replied, “I’ve cut myself
adrift from Torrington. They said if I remained
in India they would drop me altogether, so you see
I’ve burned my boats! Even if I were to humble
myself, they would never, never receive me.”</p>

<p>“Falkland will receive you,” declared my brother,
“you have not sent him one of your fiery letters?”</p>

<p>“I have never sent him any letter at all.”</p>

<p>“How’s that? You have done one mad thing
in pitching your tent at Bangalore, although I know
it has been for my sake. You will be still madder
if you break off with Falkland, who honestly is a
rattling good fellow. If only I’d taken his hints
and pulled up a bit I wouldn’t be here now, a disgrace
to myself and to you.”</p>

<p>“Never mind me,” I protested, “but tell me
how you are getting on?”</p>

<p>“How can I get on until I get out?” he replied
with a touch of his former manner. “I still have to
serve one year eight months and two days. I
must say the superintendent is a white man, although
his colour <i>is</i> a bit dusky. He keeps me as much
apart from the rabble as he can, and now I’ve promotion
I am a sort of official myself. When I first
came here, Sis, if I’d seen any means of committing
suicide I’d have taken my own life. I was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
hopelessly, abjectly miserable; the more I thought,
the worse I felt; but do you know, one day, when I
was in the very deepest depths of black despair in
the labour yard, I distinctly heard your voice calling
me, and that gave me a wonderful ‘buck up,’ and
reminded me that I wasn’t altogether alone in the
world.”</p>

<p>I debated in my own mind whether I would tell
him that he had really heard me or not, and I
decided against it. Somehow I instinctively felt
that he would hate to know that I had witnessed
him doing hard labour in company with thieves
and murderers.</p>

<p>“Did you find my little notes in the books?” I
asked. “Writing in that way was, I know, deceitful,
but I hoped you would come across some of my
scribbling.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, rather&mdash;and that cheered me no end.
Knowing that you were in the station, and that I
would see you, raised me out of the Slough of
Despond.”</p>

<p>“There,” I exclaimed, “so I <i>was</i> right to come
after all!”</p>

<p>“Do you know anybody in the station?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“No, not a soul! I lie low all the time. I associate
with Mrs. de Castro’s friends&mdash;sergeants’ wives and
the wives of telegraph clerks, and so on.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. de Castro’s friends!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I like them,” I said, “they know that
I have some trouble and are most truly kind and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
sympathetic. It’s a very good thing to see another
side of life.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Eva, you have seen a good many sides
of life, what with Beke, the old professor, and Mrs.
Hayes-Billington, and now <i>my</i> crash&mdash;your experience
has been extraordinarily varied.”</p>

<p>“I said that I know nobody here, and no
one knows me, but the other Sunday in church I
thought I caught a glimpse of Sally Payne.
I don’t think she recognised me, and I sneaked
out before the sermon. She <i>has</i> been here, because
in reading the <i>Bangalore Herald</i> I saw among the
list of guests at the West End Hotel, ‘Miss Payne
and maid.’ I was always fond of Sally,” I added,
“and I think she liked me. Do you remember
we arrived in Secunderabad on the very same
day?”</p>

<p>“I wish she could take you out of Bangalore,”
said Ronnie. “Because my life is spoiled there is
no reason that yours should be. You have helped
me over the first bad bit, and I shall rub along all
right now. If I have any luck I might get something
taken off my sentence. The superintendent
talked about putting me in the office to do the jail
accounts, but I’d rather have my present job. I’m
more independent, and I’d hate having to sit and
write all day long.”</p>

<p>“Are they troublesome, your ward?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, not with me. You see, I understand order
and discipline from being in the Service. I stand no
nonsense, and soon wheel them into line, but they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
<i>are</i> a rough lot. Some such powerful murderous-looking
brutes.”</p>

<p>I was telling Ronnie about the superintendent’s
wife, how she had taken me out to drive, and invited
me to sit in her garden as often as I liked, when a
warder entered, salaamed, and said:</p>

<p>“Sorry, Miss Sahib&mdash;the time is up.”</p>

<span>HYDER ALI’S GARDEN</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">My</span> new acquaintances, Mr. and Mrs. Hodson, were
both very kind to me; she frequently called to take
me for a drive into the country (Hibbal way).
Afterwards we sat in her delightful garden with
its spreading grass plots, clumps of bamboo and
loquat trees, and profusion of English flowers. The
sole drawback to this Elysium was the presence of
convicts, clanking to and fro, as they watered and
worked among the vegetables; but I suppose in
time one grows accustomed to anything&mdash;as it is
said of poor eels, with respect to their skins!</p>

<p>Thanks to Mr. Hodson, I had several private interviews
with Ronnie. I was permitted to give him cigarettes,
and to supply him with papers. He no longer
gave way to an unreasoning frenzy of despair, but was
more like his former self; his eyes had their old boyish
look, and had lost their dull, glazed appearance. I
had now been four months at Bangalore; the time
had crawled like centuries, and as I gazed into my
glass I told myself that I was almost unrecognisable.
Undoubtedly the shocks I had received since I left
England had told upon my appearance. My face was
white and very thin, and my hair, of which I had once
been rather proud, looked lank and dead. After all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
although I kept up a certain amount of cheerfulness
with Mrs. de Castro and her friends, I sometimes
wondered that I was still alive. No one but myself
knew of the nights and nights when I lay awake
for hours or paced about my room. The weather
was hot and I would have much preferred to walk
in the compound, but for my not unnatural fear
of snakes and bandicoots. A want of sleep, want of
appetite, and a want of hope were my three chief
ailments. I had to bear up against not one, but
<i>two</i> heavy troubles. The overwhelming disgrace of
my brother and the collapse of our little home;
the cruelty of relations who had closed their ears
to our appeals. Sometimes, with a sort of rage, I
told myself that had Uncle cabled out the money to
Ronnie, he would have saved him in time. Here
was surely a sufficient load for one pair of shoulders.
But besides all this, a grief that affected me even more
acutely was the loss of my lover; this was a personal
ache that nothing could deaden or alleviate. It had
been my own fault that our correspondence had
lapsed, but to what could it have tended after all?
Brian and I could never be anything to one another.
He was naturally the soul of generosity and chivalry,
but we would have to face the Falkland family, public
opinion and general discredit. How could Lady
Louisa&mdash;said to be the incarnation of pride&mdash;receive a
daughter-in-law whose brother was a convict, the
subject of a notorious military scandal? Much as
Brian might care for me, I could never be anything
but a millstone round his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes my feelings got the better of my
convictions, and an intolerable longing surged up in
my heart. At night I would sit down and pour out
my soul in long letters. These letters gave me
a wonderful amount of temporary relief, but when
I read them over in the cool light of morning I invariably
destroyed them. I had not had a line from
Brian for more than six weeks, and such is the perversity
of human nature, now that he had ceased
to write to me I felt an almost irrepressible temptation
to write to him! Nevertheless I did not yield to
it, though I often debated the question&mdash;to write or not
to write? Even if I wrote, and assured him, as before,
that all was at an end between us, but that I was
in Bangalore, and would be glad to hear from him
occasionally&mdash;to what good would this tend? It
was far better and wiser to drop entirely out of his
life, but this resolve did not conduce to happiness or
even consolation.</p>

<p>Kipper’s spirits were undoubtedly affected by
my own condition of hopeless depression&mdash;it may
have been the effect of a brain wave&mdash;but at any
rate whenever we took our walks abroad he no
longer bounded exuberantly in front of me, barking
from purest <i>joie de vivre</i>, and challenging all creation
from lizards to camels. Now he kept sedately to
heel like a sober elderly dog, obviously on duty
and in sole charge of an elderly mistress. When
indoors he lay motionless beside my chair or bed,
following my movements with anxious and adoring
eyes, and occasionally heaving tremendous sighs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span></p>

<p>He found his simple relaxation in killing bandicoots
(a rat-like creature with a blunt repulsive
face) and in the visits of the tall yellow and white
pariah, who lived next door. I must confess that
this intimacy filled me with amazement. At Beke,
Kipper had kept coldly aloof from the society of
his own kind, and had cruelly and even painfully
snubbed the advances of second-rate dogs. If these
could but behold him now!&mdash;abandoned to the fascination
and blandishments of a hideous spotted alien,
resembling a low class overgrown lurcher; rolling with
him luxuriously in the dust, running mad puppy
circles, and playing hide and seek among the shrubs
and oleander bushes in Mrs. de Castro’s compound!
I will say this for Kipper, he never returned the
visits of his playfellow, and had still some lingering
sense of <i>les convenances</i> and etiquette for “Europe”
terriers.</p>

<p>Once, when the “Pi” had the audacity to join us
in our walk, and came prancing towards us with a
“Hallo, well met!” expression on his cunning
long face, Kipper realised that he must draw
the line here, and after a word or two in nosy
dog talk, the intruder accepted a hint, and disappeared.</p>

<p>One evening we had been for a constitutional
far beyond the high ground and racecourse, and I
returned to the de Castro bungalow dusty, thirsty
and tired, looking forward, I confess, to a good cup
of Neilgherry tea. As we entered the veranda, Kip
stood for a second motionless, and then flew like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
wild creature into the cave-like drawing-room, and
I said to myself:</p>

<p>“The Pi is there, lying in wait for him! He
must <i>not</i> be allowed into the house.”</p>

<p>I was about to follow and eject the intruder,
when Mrs. de Castro came forward in a state of
unusual excitement and with much nodding and
gesticulation informed me in a mysterious whisper:</p>

<p>“A lame gentleman has called to see you. He
came in a motor. I told him that you were out,
but he said he would wait; and he has been
sitting in the drawing-room for more than an
hour.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunate wretch!” I thought to myself,
“who can it be?”</p>

<p>Well, there was no use in speculating, I would soon
see. Perhaps some friend of Ronnie’s? As I entered
the drawing-room&mdash;which was dim even at noonday&mdash;a
tall man, leaning on a stick, came hobbling towards
me, and as he approached the door I saw, to
my stupefaction, that it was <i>Brian</i>!</p>

<p>“Eva,” he exclaimed, “so I have found you!”</p>

<p>I was so overwhelmed with astonishment and joy
that I was obliged to sit down, and then, like the poor,
weak fool that I was, I immediately began to cry.
Brian drew up a chair beside me, seated himself, and
gripped my nearest hand.</p>

<p>“You did not suppose,” he said, “that I was
going to allow you to slip out of my life like that,
did you? I told you once upon a time that I was
tenacious. I did not tell you then, but I say to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
now, that the day we met on Slackland’s Flats&mdash;looking
into your eyes, I beheld my destiny&mdash;and to
my destiny I hold fast. I would have been here six
weeks ago or less, but I was smashed up in a motor
accident&mdash;concussion and a broken leg&mdash;simple
fracture&mdash;and so they kept me in a nursing home,
whether I liked it or not. As soon as I could stand
I escaped and came out by the mail&mdash;and here
I am!”</p>

<p>“How did you find me?” I faltered.</p>

<p>“Tell me first, are you glad to see me&mdash;as glad
as Kipper?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered, “so very, very glad&mdash;though
your coming can make no difference in one way.
Do tell me how you found that I was in Bangalore?”</p>

<p>“It was through that little brick, Sally Payne.
She is as sharp as they make ’em, and she had an idea
that, instead of burying yourself in a hill station, or
going home, you had followed your brother down to
Bangalore. She said it would be so like you&mdash;and
she was right. Sally saw you on her way to the
Neilgherries; she stayed here for a few days looking
about. She heard from her maid, who heard from
her ayah, who heard it in the bazaar, that ‘a tall
young English lady lodging in Infantry Lines had
apparently no friends&mdash;and there was something
mysterious about her.’ Then one Sunday she caught
sight of you in church, and cabled to me at once;
and now, Eva, I suppose you understand that I have
come out on purpose to take you home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span></p>

<p>“No, no!” I protested; “I cannot desert
Ronnie. Think of it&mdash;how could I!”</p>

<p>“From what I know of Ronnie he will never
agree to such an unnecessary sacrifice. How is he
getting on?”</p>

<p>“At first he wanted to kill himself, but since he
has seen me he has recovered a little. The superintendent
is as lenient and thoughtful as he dare
venture; and, after all, a European prisoner, especially
if he is well behaved and gives no trouble, may
have a little more margin than, say, a murderer from
the West Coast. Ronnie is now a convict warder.
I saw him three days ago, and he seemed to be in
better spirits.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if I may be allowed to visit him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am sure you may.”</p>

<p>“I am also sure, from what I know of your
brother, that he has no wish for you to remain in
this country. Come now, answer me&mdash;tell me the
truth&mdash;what does he say?”</p>

<p>“He urges me to return to England, but I know
I am a comfort to him. Even if I would go Torrington
is closed to me. They gave me my choice
of remaining here, or having a home with them.
Aunt Mina wrote that if I stayed in India on
Ronnie’s account they washed their hands of me
for ever and ever.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Eva, Torrington is not the <i>only</i>
home that is open to you in England. What about
mine?”</p>

<p>“And your people, and your mother?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span></p>

<p>“My mother sees eye to eye with me in this. I
have brought you a letter from her. She knows all
about you, and admires your devotion, as you will
see. Now, my dear Eva, I should like to see <i>you</i>.
This room is nearly pitch dark, and, by Jove!&mdash;what
a room it is! But apparently your old landlady
thinks no end of it; she has been sitting here part
of the time to keep me company, and has told me
the price of every single piece of furniture. She also
told me, what interests me far more, that she is very
fond of you, and what was a shock&mdash;that she does
not think you are long for this world! Now call a
fellow to bring lamps; I should like to be able to
judge for myself!”</p>

<p>In two or three minutes our factotum staggered
in with a lamp in each hand. As soon as he had
hung one on the wall, placed the other on the
round table, and enjoyed a thoroughly exhaustive
stare at Brian, he withdrew.</p>

<p>“Now,” said my companion, “take off your
hat.”</p>

<p>As I removed it unquestioningly and faced him
in silence, I saw his eyes open, his lips close tightly;
there was not the slightest doubt that the awful
change in my appearance had administered a
shock! I was painfully conscious that of my former
prettiness not a trace remained. Brian rose, stick
in hand, turned his back upon me, and limped towards
the door. Yes, I was a wreck&mdash;apparently
the sight had been too overwhelming; but surely
he was not about to leave me like <i>that</i>? I hurried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
after him, and discovered that it was merely a
manœuvre to conceal his emotion.</p>

<p>“My poor little girl,” he murmured in a broken
voice, “every word of the whole terrible story is
written in your face.”</p>

<p>He gathered me into his arms, and for once I shed
tears of happiness.</p>

<span>THE ORDER OF RELEASE</span></h2>
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Hospitable</span> Mrs. de Castro gave Brian a pressing
invitation to remain to dinner and share “pot luck,”
represented, as I happened to know, by brain cutlets
and Bombay toast&mdash;no fare for an invalid. He
was about to accept with effusion, when he caught
my swift signal of unqualified horror and murmured
a polite excuse. At half-past seven a motor brought
his man-servant to escort him to the West End
Hotel, and he departed with reluctance, assuring me
that he “would be round first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p>“My, but that gentleman do set store by you,”
announced Mrs. de Castro, as soon as he was out
of sight. “All the questions he asked about your
health! I told him as your hair was falling in handsful,
enough to stuff a cushion, and you could not
abide your food, and your dress bodies were taken
in inches round the waist, and the skirts just a-slipping
off you. My word, but he was in a way.
He says he has come to take you home.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Mrs. de Castro,” I protested with
emphasis. “I shall stay here.”</p>

<p>“How could you have the heart to say no to a
fellow with such lovely eyes? I’m sure <i>I</i> never
could&mdash;and he was just counting the weary time till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
you come back, looking at his watch every two
minutes. Well, I’m thinking you have a hard
heart. Your brother has had his turn&mdash;has the
other no claim?”</p>

<p>The next morning Brian had a long interview with
Ronnie&mdash;our good friend Mr. Hodson being present&mdash;and
when in the early afternoon we went for a
motor drive Brian told me the gist of their conference.</p>

<p>“Ronnie is anxious for you to return to England
with me. On this point he and I are absolutely
agreed,” announced my companion. “I have assured
him that I shall pull every string I can reach to get
his sentence reduced. I may be mistaken, but I
have an impression that three months’ hard labour
for a gentleman means as much as six to a working
coolie, and I am sure the indignity bites in ten times
more deeply. As soon as Ronnie is released we will
give him a real good start in the colonies. Meanwhile
the Hodsons will keep a kindly eye on him,
and he will feel that you and I are working like
niggers on his behalf.”</p>

<p>This conversation took place as we sped into the
open country, and Brian said:</p>

<p>“I am doing all the talking. What has happened
to my prize chatterbox?”</p>

<p>“Neither a prize nor a chatterbox now,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you will return to your old form.
Already you look a shade better, and you have laughed
once. Have you read my mother’s letter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span></p>

<p>“I have indeed. It is too, too kind&mdash;I shall
treasure it always.”</p>

<p>“She <i>is</i> a dear old Mum, I must say! Well now,
shall we turn round and go to the Lal Bagh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you like, but why the Lal Bagh?”</p>

<p>“My father often talked of it when he had a
reminiscent fit. He was quartered here forty-three
years ago. His regiment was the Blue Hussars; their
band played at the Lal Bagh, and all the beauty
and fashion processed about like peacocks.”</p>

<p>“No beauty and fashion are to be seen there
now, only nurses and soldiers and Eurasians&mdash;except
on show days, at long intervals. Polo and golf and
the club have combined to write ‘Ichabod’ over
the Lal Bagh.”</p>

<p>“Well, let us go and see it all the same. I’d
like to walk, or rather hobble, round in the pater’s
footsteps.”</p>

<p>The Lal Bagh, or Red Garden, said to have been
laid out by Hyder Ali, is an immense straggling
enclosure, full of wonderful exotic plants and great
trees shading long walks; it also contains many
cages of wild animals.</p>

<p>This exhibition never appealed to me. I always
felt so sorry for the animals; they looked, as a
rule, hungry and miserable. We turned, therefore, in
another direction and I gave my arm to Brian, who
leant on me and his stick. Presently we found our
way to the terrace and a seat. Here there was no
one to disturb our <i>tête-à-tête</i>. We were entirely
surrounded by the beauties of Nature; a wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
profusion of sweet-scented flowering creepers, these
and the palms, ferns, and forest trees in Hyder Ali’s
old garden seemed to envelop us in an atmosphere of
enchantment and peace.</p>

<p>There was the blazing “Sally Bindon,” the “Flame
of the Jungle,” the yellow Burmese forest flower,
and the rose-pink “Antigone,” with its clusters of
blossoms, each and all draping trees and walls
in our immediate vicinity. The cloudless sky
was of a deep turquoise blue, the air soft and
balmy, bulbuls sang in the rose bushes, brilliant
butterflies and dragon-flies darted to and fro; the
silence was languorous with serenity and ecstasy.
We were in another world, far, far away from
shame, disgrace and misery. As I sat absorbed in
the scene and my own thoughts I was considerably
startled to hear Brian say:</p>

<p>“Well, now, Eva our next step is to be married!”</p>

<p>“What!” I exclaimed, “but surely not here&mdash;not
in India?”</p>

<p>“Why not in India? You could not return with
me by train and ship as Miss Lingard! ‘Miss Lingard
and maid, Captain Falkland and valet’&mdash;how do you
think that would look? And what would Mrs. Potter
say? No, no, I shall fix it all up with the chaplain.
You won’t want any trousseau or wedding reception&mdash;for
the latter, Heaven be praised! Sally Payne
shall come down from Ooty, and give you away.”</p>

<p>“She has done that already,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“And are you not obliged to her? Anyway, <i>I</i>
am in her debt for life. We will invite the Hodsons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
and Mrs. de Castro, and have what is called a ‘quiet
wedding.’ No presents, no favours, no cake.”</p>

<p>“I see you have it all cut and dried,” I said;
“you have taken my breath away.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about your breath,” he replied,
“but I shall certainly take you&mdash;or what remains
of you&mdash;away. On our journey home we will stop
in Switzerland for a time, and there, among the mountains,
you may be able to pick up your spirits and
recover your youth. Otherwise your miserable white
face may be attributed to <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the last four or five months have
left a mark upon me. Somehow I don’t think I can
ever look or feel as I used to do until Ronnie is free.”</p>

<p>“There is four o’clock striking,” said Brian, “and
no doubt you will be thirsting for tea. Shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have had a long day for an invalid, and
I am sure Mrs. de Castro, who is much taken with
‘my gentleman friend,’ has made a cake in your
honour.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said rising, “we can do the fort
to-morrow, and just take a run round the station
and the barracks before we steer for Infantry Lines.”</p>

<p>As we rolled smoothly along my companion urged
me to give him an answer to the question of a speedy
wedding. I could see his point of view; business
matters in England claimed his attention; he also
declared I must have an immediate change of climate.
I begged to have a day or two to consider the question
and to talk it over with Ronnie.</p>

<p>When we drove under the lattice-work porch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
I was amazed to find Mrs. Hodson on the steps. At
a second glance I saw that she looked paler than ever
and was evidently unnerved.</p>

<p>“There has been an accident to your brother,”
she began the instant the car stopped, “and I have
come to fetch you,” pointing to where her victoria
was drawn up at the side of the bungalow.</p>

<p>“We can all go up in the motor,” said Brian
promptly, “it will take us there in five minutes.
Please get in, Mrs. Hodson,” and he made room for
her.</p>

<p>Without a second’s hesitation she accepted his
offer, sat down beside me, and seized my hand. Then
I knew for certain that the matter was serious;
people invariably took me by the hand when
tragedy was approaching.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” I whispered with dry lips.</p>

<p>“We have been searching for you since three
o’clock. There was a bad outbreak this afternoon
in your brother’s ward. Several notorious characters
fell upon others with whom they had a blood
feud; they fought with their spades and mallets,
and one powerful brute, a Moplah, wrenched off
his irons and battered a warder to death. Your
brother fought like ten heroes&mdash;so much for an
English gentleman! Finally he overpowered the
ringleader, but a cowardly blow on the back of his
head struck him to the ground at the very moment
when the riot was quelled. I am afraid Captain
Lingard is badly hurt; he is in the infirmary,
and besides the jail doctor we have sent for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
civil surgeon. All that is possible has been done.
He has a fine constitution and may recover&mdash;while
there is life, there is hope.” She paused for breath
and added, inconsequently: “I am thankful that
Captain Falkland is here.”</p>

<p>For my own part I felt so utterly crushed that
I was speechless. A five minutes’ run had brought
us to the jail, and at the entrance we were met by
Mr. Hodson. We followed him in dead silence into
the infirmary, and there, on a low cot behind a
screen, we found Ronnie. One glance was sufficient
to tell me that he had received his death blow.
He would very soon be <i>free</i>!</p>

<p>Two doctors were with him, a half-caste nurse
was hovering about, and the chaplain had been
summoned. Yes, these good kind people had done all
that was possible. I could see by his eyes that Ronnie
recognised me; with an effort he said, in a strange,
far-away voice: “It’s the order of release, Sis&mdash;and
the best way out of it.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Ronnie, <i>don’t</i> say that,” I protested
as I sank on my knees beside him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he continued faintly, “I’ve nothing to
live for; nothing to leave&mdash;not even a <i>name</i>. Don’t
put it on the stone&mdash;and nothing to wish for”; with
a feeble gesture he beckoned to Brian, and laid my
hand in his; in a scarcely audible whisper, he
added, “but <i>this</i>.”</p>

<p>Then he slowly closed his eyes and relapsed into
unconsciousness. Within half an hour the unfortunate
soul of Ronald Lingard had effected its escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span></p>

<p>We heard full details of the outbreak and of
Ronnie’s heroic courage and exertions; how he and
two or three convicts and one warder held the whole
gang at bay, and how by desperate gallantry he had
saved the lives of two venerable Brahmans from
Conjeveram, forfeiting his own in the effort.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Mrs. Hodson I remained
in her quarters that night, and the next morning
Brian and I, and the Hodsons, followed a very plain
wooden coffin to the station cemetery. It may be
thought that for one who had such a cloud on his
character, and no alluring future, this resting-place
was better for Ronnie than for him to go forth from
prison and encounter the buffets of a stern implacable
world. To me it was otherwise; I had hoped that
in another country my brother would have made a
fresh start, and in a new and happier life have
eventually lived down and redeemed his past.</p>

<p>In obedience to his request the stone over his
grave is nameless. On it is merely inscribed:</p>

<p class="center">
R. M. L.<br />
<span class="smcap">Blessed are the Dead.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Brian, the practical and energetic, undertook all
business arrangements, and also distributed gifts to
those who had shown any kindness or sympathy to
the late convict, R. Lingard.</p>

<p>Mrs. de Castro was made proud and happy with
a silver teapot and a gramophone (to enliven her
receptions); to Mrs. Hodson he presented a jewelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
watch bracelet with an appropriate inscription
from B. and E. Falkland.</p>

<p>Not very long after Ronnie’s death Brian and I
were married. Our wedding took place precisely as
foretold during that hour of enchantment in Hyder
Ali’s garden, and immediately after the ceremony,
accompanied by Kipper, we left Bangalore for
Bombay.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
